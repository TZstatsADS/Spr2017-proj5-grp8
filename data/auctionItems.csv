Catalogue Note <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-wrap""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-text""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-holder""> This painting, signed and dated 1811 , repeats the composition of Peyron's celebrated workin the Muse des Augustins, Toulouse (inv. RO 195, 93 by 132 cm., signed and dated 1779 ), which was commissioned along with its pendant, Cornelia, Mother of the Gracchi , by the abb Franois de Bernis, later Archbishop of Rouen. The works probably traveled to Albi with the abb de Bernis in March 1782, though the Belisarius was exhibited, with much praise, at Palazzo Mancini in Rome in 1779. Another version of the composition (possibly the sketch for the Toulouse canvas), is in the National Gallery, London (inv. no.NG6551).<sup>1</sup> The theme of Belisarius, derived from Marmontel's novel 'Blisaire' (1767), was very popular at the time; Peyron's rival Jacques-Louis David also painted the subject, the same year that Peyron exhibited his version at Palazzo Mancini. Given the positive reception of Peyron's Toulouse canvases, particularly the Belisarius , it is unsurprising that he would have continued to produce versions of the painting for private patrons throughout his career. 1.

Based on comparison with the catalogue description and photograph from the important Leningrad Museum and Palace sale held at Lepke Auction House in Berlin in 1929, it seems probable that this is the same work that was deaccessioned by the Museum as an authentic work by Canaletto. Constable (see Literature) did not see this work firsthand, however on the basis of photographs believed it to be a school piece. The dimensions of the present work match exactly with those given in the Lepke catalogue, and despite a slight cropping of the edges in the Lepke catalogue illustration, there are no stylistic or compositional differences evident between the works. The present work repeats in composition a picture in the collection of the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego, California, traditionally given to Canaletto (see W.G. Constable with J. Links, Canaletto; Giovanni Antonio Canal, 1697-1768 , London 1976, vol. II, p.239, cat. no. 109). The view is taken from a point opposite the Ponte della Paglia . To the left of the composition is the Zecca and the Library, with the Campanile seen in the distance.

The present lot is one of the most significant paintings by Lakhovsky to ever come to auction, and an unusual subject for the artist. King Carol II (1893-1953) ruled Romania from 1930 until 1940, when he was forced to surrender parts of the country and abdicate the throne to his son, Prince Michael (b. 1921).

Also see Vincent, 1995, p. 71 for a depiction of a Nul'amal mask that has adapted lion imagery probably from a figurehead of an American or European sailing ship. In a letter from Bill Holm that accompanies the lot, he writes: ""I am quite in agreement that the lion club is very likely by the carver of the two lion figures, and that the lion motif is of European derivation. It is very interesting that this club retains the traditional form of the seal/fish club of the north, with the animal (usually a seal ion or a killer whale) carved as the striking end of the club and with a somewhat constricted grip with enlarge pommel and some kind of grooving apparently to improve the grip, The choice of the African lion for the club, I think, has less to do with the analogy of the sealion than with its apparent relationship to the two lion sculptured figures. Whether they were at one time a set is probably going to be impossible to determine, but it certainly is possible. European lion sculpture was certainly the inspiration for a number of lion-like figures in Northwest Coast art. The clearest examples are certain Nulmal masks of the Quatsino Sound area of Vancouver Island...There are quite a few in collections around the world. Many years ago I read a paper at UCLA on the subject of ""Some Further Conundrums in Northwest Coast Indian Art"" in which I theorized at length about the origin of this form of the Nulmal mask and compared it with European examples, some from architectural details but most (and most likely as a source) from ships' carvings. You mention that there is ""reference to an English ship of the line, with lion figurehead. As a matter of fact, the lion was so common as a figurehead that the term ""lion"" was at one point nearly synonymous with ""figurehead."" However I think a more likely source was the ""cathead"" carving. The sailing ships of the early historic period on tile Northwest Coast had timbers called ""catheads"" protruding over the bows and to which the anchors were raised. The ends of these timbers were often carved, the most common design being a lion's head. I believe these were the source of the lion-type Nulmal mask, as they were even more ubiquitous than lion figureheads. I also believe that the lion-like carving (it is not a mask) in the pictures you sent, described as ""found in the first Christian church in old Metlakatla"" and now in the Royal British Columbia Museum, is not an Indian carving, but is probably a ship's carving. Although the two lion figures that George Terasaki had seem certainly to be from the Northwest Coast, the idea of that origin is very much strengthened by this club, which is without any doubt a northern Northwest Coast production. I think that Steve Brown's assessment of a pre-1850 Haida origin is quite believeable."""1104,21-May-14,arts-of-the-american-west-n09149,Arts of the American West,USD,['American Indian'],"RARE NORTHWEST COAST POLYCHROMED WOOD CLAN HAT, TSIMSHIAN OR TLINGIT",500000,88,TRUE,300000,"['Gold/silver/metal', 'Textile/beadwork', 'Hide', 'Other', 'Wood']",365000,,['Mask/headdress'],2014,"of convex tapering form, finely incised with a totemic bird design, probably a raven, with an elongated beak, pointed oval eyerims beneath stylized ears, and backswept feather ruff, painted overall in black and vermillion red details with scalloping, crosshatching and other classic crest motifs, surmounted by a series of five cedarbarkpotlatch rings trimmed on the topwith a plaque of brilliant abalone,red wool stroud, dentallium shell, ermine and a beaded hide pendantwith tiny, glass seed beads in pink and white, large faceted beads in blue, yellow, orange and black, and tubular brass beads. length 19 3/4 in. by height 13 1/2 in.

Though the Jewish quarter of Padua was sacked, loss of life was averted through the intervention of the Doge in Venice. To commemorate the narrowly averted tragedy, the Jews of Padua established a local festival, which they called ""Purim of Buda."" A local rabbi, Isaac Vita Cantarini (1644-1723), composed a Hebrew poem which became the centerpiece of an annual liturgical celebration; in the present manuscript, this poem is accompanied by s elihot , or penitential prayers, also incorporated into the Paduan liturgy for the annual commemoration of the city's salvation. Ironically, though the Jews of Padua were spared, the Jews of Buda, for whom this special Purim celebration was named, suffered grievous losses at the hands of the invading Austrian and Venetian troops when the city eventually fell in 1686. The decorated red and black title page indicates that the manuscript was written by Gabriel ben Isaac Hai Conian (Conegliano).

Most Jewish artisans chose to form their own hevrot (societies), rather than joining the established guilds, most of which had an overtly distinct Christian character, thus effectively precluding Jewish membership. In the major Moldovian city of Jassy, there were at least six different associations representing various groups of Jewish tradesmen, including tailors, hatters, furriers, weavers, shoemakers and leatherworkers. This elaborately decorated and elegantly penned manuscript pinkas (ledger) is the only surviving material witness to these Jewish workers groups.

Containing the text of the Pentateuch and written by hand on specially prepared parchment by a trained scribe according to traditions that date back thousands of years, Torah scrolls are most often used for public worship services in Jewish communities around the world. The scrolls used in most synagogues are typically large and heavy, and while most of these scrolls are communally owned, there is concurrently a long tradition of private ownership of scrolls as well. In fact, Judaism considers both the ownership and the writing of Torah scrolls to be obligatory positive commandments. Torah scrolls of such minute dimensions are extremely rare. Naturally, the degree of proficiency required to produce such a small Torah Scroll was beyond the ability of all but the most skilled scribes. The tradition of creating such small and therefore easily portable scrolls doubtlessly emanates from the circumstances surrounding the Jews long peregrinations in exile and the all too frequent persecutions to which they were historically subjected. The small size and reduced weight of a miniature scroll meant that the Jewish people could always take the Torah with them, wherever they went. The uniform extreme thinness of the parchment on this exquisite Torah means that unlike other less aesthetic attempts at producing truly minuscule scrolls, the width of this scroll in relation to its height is visually pleasing and in compliance with halakhic guidelines found in the Talmud ( Bava Batra 14a) that call for a specific ratio of 3:2 between height and width. Other small scrolls, executed on less fine, and consequently thicker, parchment sheets, nearly alwayslack the appropriate proportionality. This is a rare and perhaps unique example of a minuscule scroll whose dimensions are halakhically appropriate. No other scroll has ever been offered at public sale which so magnificently combines the quality of scribal artistry, incredibly small size, and pleasing proportionality, and which so seamlessly combines these qualities, as does the present lot. The present scroll is accompaniedby a rabbinical certificateattesting to its ritual fitness for liturgical use."1142,17-Dec-13,judaica-n09060,Important Judaica,USD,['19th/20th century'],"A PAIR OF MOROCCAN PARCEL-GILT SILVER TORAH FINIALS, CIRCA 1900",10000,11,TRUE,7000,['Parcel-gilt silver'],8750,,"['Ceremonial & ritual', 'Judaica']",2013,"baluster form chased with flowers and foliage, openwork gallery with spiral columns and swags suspending bells, finial also fitted with bells apparently unmarked height 14 in. 35.6cm"1143,17-Dec-13,judaica-n09060,Important Judaica,USD,['Continental books and manuscripts'],"A DECORATED KETUBBAH FROM ANCONA, 1779",35000,110,TRUE,25000,['Manuscripts'],28750,,['Art'],2013,"Gouache and inkon parchment (25 x 19 in.; 63.5 x 48 cm).

The tractate contains a large percentage of aggadic material as well as important historical material concerning the relations between Jews and non-Jews. It conveys information on a variety of religions including Christianity, Gnosticism and Zoroastrianism. In light of the often troubled relations with non-Jewish authorities, copies of this tractate, subject as they often were to heightened scrutiny and censorship, have always been particularly scarce. Horayot (Rulings), is a rather short tractate in three chapters, attached to the order of Nezikin, whose scriptural basis may be found in Leviticus ch. 4 and Numbers ch. 15. Those biblical sections deal with ""sinning through error,"" and the Talmud extrapolates to discuss erroneous rulings by the high priest or the high court ( Sanhedrin ), leading to the inadvertent violation of precepts, which, if willfully transgressed, would have been deserving of karet . The Gemara of the Jerusalem Talmud to Horayot was appended to the Babylonian tractate by Bomberg because he found no tosafot to this tractate and the Jerusalem Gemara took its place on the page. For centuries, Bomberg's edition represented the authoritative version of this tractate. 'Eduyyot' (Testimonies). Unlike other tractates, which usually deal with a particular subject, 'Eduyyot (Testimonies), is a collection of a laws on a wide variety of topics. Its title reflects the purpose of the collection: to put on record the ""testimonies"" given by later sages on the halakhic pronouncements and controversies of earlier authorities. Thus, the phrase ""rabbi so-and-so testified"" ( he'id ) frequently occurs, especially in the later chapters. The fact that the correctness of the respective halakhic traditions were established before a court and consequently designated as ""testimonies,"" may also explain why this tractate was included in the order Nezikin, which to a large extent treats of law and procedure.

Catalogue Note <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-wrap""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-text""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-holder""> This volume contains the final four tractates of the Mishnaic order Kodashim. These tractates deal chiefly with sacrifices and the attendant Temple rites. Me'ilah deals with the unlawful use and enjoyment of hekdesh (i.e., things consecrated to the Temple, especially sacrifices.) Kinnim means ""nest"" or ""birds in a nest,"" and deals with the pairs of sacrificial birds brought to the Temple for a variety of ritual sacrifices, some of which were considered obligatory and others, voluntary. Middot (measures) gives exact details and measurements of the building of the Temple and of its component parts, intended perhaps to serve as a guide for the future rebuilding of the Temple. The descriptions refer to the Temple as rebuilt by Herod. They reflect the memory of those sages who were still alive following the destruction of the Temple, and who passed on an oral description of it to their disciples. Tamid is an abbreviated form for olat ha-tamid (daily burnt-offering), and refers to the twice-daily sacrifices as set out at various places in the Hebrew Bible. The tractate is not actually concerned with these sacrifices; rather, it gives a description of the priests' daily Temple service, from the moment the priests set about their work early in the day until after the tamid sacrifice was organized later in the morning. In addition the texts of three minor tractates, Semahot , Kalah , and Soferim ,deal with mourning, marriage, and the writing of sacred texts, respectively. The contemporary recognition of the enormity of Daniel Bombergs achievement in bringing the entire Babylonian Talmud to press is summed up in the lengthy and moving colophon, which appearson the final printed page, and was written by Bomberg'scolleague, Cornelius Adelkind: Praise and thanksgiving to He who is the CreatorHe roused the spirit of our lord Daniel Bomberg to print the Babylonian Talmud with Rashis commentary, Tosafot, Piskei Tosafot, and Maimonides commentary on the Mishnah, and the novellae of the strong hammer, the Asheri (Asher ben Jehiel). And he gathered and assembled the entire Talmud and these commentaries, which had been scattered in every land both distant and near and joined to them many other books. And [so] he accomplished more than his predecessors. He expended his fortune and his wealth and sent couriers, riding swift steeds, to call the finest craftsman that could be found in all these regions to do this awesome work. He designated me, one of the brothers, the sons of Barukh Adelkind, and said to me, Arise, gird now your loins as a man, and allot, apportion, and divide all these commentaries throughout the Talmud according to the light of your intelligence and they will be consolidated in your hands. I responded, My lord, behold I am ready and prepared to do your command and to carry out your will as you desire and as I perceive it. And as I saw that one should not refuse and turn away empty handed a person of excellence and nobility, I bestirred myself as God had graced me I separated and established the two great spheres, the prince, Rashi and the Tosafot to illuminate the eyes of the readers I divided them in equal parts on every page from the Talmud nothing was added or removed At the end of each and every Talmud is the Piskei Tosafot so the reader will have in his hand after studying the halakhic decision which should serve as a balm and also added is the commentary of Maimonides All this was achieved through great efforts. The Lord knows how much pain and great trouble we had as there was much work and numerous commentaries. If I erred or made a mistake in any matter, let the reader judge me meritoriously. He should know that it was not done intentionally. It was an offense done in error, not an offense committed in bad faith, for the material was sometimes difficult. I place my supplication before He who gives the weary strength, who bestowed upon me the merit to complete, divide, establish and arrange all the orders of the Babylonian Talmud. So may He grant me the merit with the Jerusalem Talmud, which our lord Daniel Bomberg [may his Rock and Redeemer protect him] has prepared to print with the remaining holy books which he has sent to bring from all lands where they are scattered With this merit may the Lord assist our master Daniel, the son of Cornelius Bomberg, and make him strong and courageous so that he may go from achievement to achievement and grant him increase and prosperity.

His broad theological expertiseallowed him to present Judaism in a sympathetic manner acceptable to the Christian world. His writings proved especially influential in England, where Jews had been forbidden to settle, since their expulsion in the late13th century.In 1650 Menasseh dedicated his work, The Hope of Israel , to the English Parliament in an effort to solicit their goodwill and thereby helped in bringing about the eventual readmission of the Jews to England. This work describes the reported discovery, in the New World, of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.

To support his cause Menasseh marshaled both utilitarian arguments demonstrating the profitability to England of admitting Jews as well theological contentions that appealed to a widespread sense of Christian Millenialism that obtained among English Puritans. The issue of whether or not to readmit the Jews was fiercely debated in the pages of competing tracts and pamphlets. Though Cromwell himself viewed Menassehs petition favorably, the proposal met with a considerable backlash as Englishmen opposed to the reentry let loose a torrent of verbal protest, including but not limited to the ugly resurrection of the blood libel. The author of this volume, William Hughes, is especially cynical regarding Menassehs assertion that the imminent Redemption rides on the Jews readmission to England. In the end, Cromwell took no formal action and dissolved the conference that was to debate the question. The lack of legislation one way or the other proved to be beneficial to the Jews in the long run as the following year, the Jews to England were granted rights to a cemetery and private prayer, thus effectively concretizing, de facto, their readmission.

This accusation was based primarily on amulets Eybeshuetz had written in Metz for the protection of pregnant women. Eybeschuetz had recently been appointed chief rabbi in the triple community of Altona, Hamburg and Wandsbeck, and the allegation of his being a closeted Sabbatian led to a controversy that divided the EuropeanJewry, particularly rabbinic circlesinto two warring camps.

With the connivance of the Pasha and the French Consul, a group of Jews were thrown into prison and accused of having murdered a Franciscan friar for ritual purposes. The news spread rapidly throughout the world, and while diplomatic and rescue efforts were being launched, the ""Damascus Affair"" was everywhere discussed and argued. As might be expected, the Times of London gave the developing story extensive coverage, the newspaper printed letters upholding or condemning the charge, and devoted several editorials of its own to the topic. On August 17th, 1840, the Times went further. On page 3 of the issue of that day, it printed a complete English translation of the Passover Haggadah. It was an attempt to submit further evidence of the absurdity of the charge that Jews require Christian blood for the Passover ritual. Coincidentally, the Times also editorialized favorably on prospects for the restoration of the Jews to Palestine. Of the Jews who had been imprisoned and tortured, one died and another accepted conversion to Islam in order to avoid further suffering. The rest were freed at the end of August, largely as a result of Sir Moses Montefiore's journey to the Near East in order to intercede personally in their behalf. <u>References</u>: Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, Haggadah and History , pl. 95, pp. 77-79; S. and V.D.

For Christians, the possibility that Chinese Jews may have had older, and thus, more accurate copies of Hebrew biblical texts untainted by what they suspected were rabbinic and Talmudicembellishments, inspired them to begin a several hundred year attempt to make contact with the Chinese Jews. In 1850, two couriers from an English missionary group established the firstcontact with theJewish community ofKaifeng. The two couriers returned to Shanghai with Hebrew books and the following year purchased six of the community's 12 Torah scrolls and some 40 additional Hebrew manuscripts from the Kaifeng Jews.

According to Morris A. Gutstein's The Story of the Jews of Newport, there were between sixty and seventy Jewish families in town at the time of the dedication. Rev. Isaac Touro, previously from Curacao, served as the Hazzan of the congregation. In addition to funds provided by Newport Jewry, other Sephardic congregations which contributed to the construction expenses included New York's Shearith Israel (the principal donor outside Newport), and congregations in London, Amsterdam, Curacao and Surinam. Peter Harrison, a pupil of Sir Christopher Wren, was the synagogue's architect. The design was in Georgian style, with Harrison's modification known as ""classic colonial,"" influenced by the traditional synagogue architecture of Spanish-Portuguese synagogues in the Netherlands. The structure, commonly referred to as the Touro Synagogue, is the oldest functioning Jewish house of worship in the United States and is today, a National Historic Site. Following several years of construction and furnishing, the dedication took place on the Friday afternoon of December 2, 1763, which corresponded with the first day of Hanukah of the Jewish year 5523. The annual commemoration of the re-consecration of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem in 165 BCE by the Hasmoneans under the leadership of Judah the Macabbee, was doubtlessly seen as an auspicious time for Newports Jews to dedicate their own house of worship. Both Jews and non-Jews celebrated the occasion; among the invited dignitaries was Dr. Ezra Stiles, a Christian Hebraist and future president of Yale College. The account of the dedication describes a handsome procession in which were carried the books of the law, to be deposited in the ark, and called to mind the Majesty and grandeur of the ancient Jewish worship mentioned in Scripture."1183,17-Dec-13,judaica-n09060,Important Judaica,USD,['Americana'],"A SERMON PREACHED AT THE SYNAGOGUE IN NEWPORT ...

Washington replied thanking the congregation for its congratulations and confidence in him.

He single-handedly provided American Jews with many of the basic religious texts, institutions, and conceptual tools they needed to construct the cultural foundation of what would later emerge as the largest Jewish community in the history of the Jewish people. Printed in 1845, this edition of the Pentateuch in five volumes, entitled The Law of God , included a vocalized Hebrew text of each of the Five Books of Moses together with an English translation and notes, as well as the haftarot (prophetic readings). Leeser actually began working on The Law of God , in 1838. According to Lance Sussman, three factors were involved in his decision to begin systematically working on a translation at this time. First, Leeser had recently completed his six-volume rendition of The Form of Prayers According to the Custom of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews (1838) and felt encouraged by his English version of the Psalms in the Sephardic Liturgy. Second, Rebecca Gratz's Sunday School met for the first time in March 1838, in Philadelphia, and was desperately in need of appropriate study material. Students were compelled to use the King James Bible for want of a Jewish alternative. Religiously objectionable passages in other texts provided by Protestant organizations were either pasted over or torn out by Gratz's staff. Leeser, who supported the Sunday School and was its chief academic resource person, felt compelled to find more suitable texts for the students. Finally, a popular German-Jewish translation of the Hebrew Bible by Leopold Zunz had just been published in 1837-38. Leeser used the translation in Zunz's liturgy as the prototype for his own work. After seven years, his translations of the Pentateuch appeared in 1845. This was followed by Biblia Hebraica (1848), the first vocalized Bible printed in America, and, finally, his complete Twenty-Four Books of the Holy Scriptures (1853-54). The last named work was the first English translation of the complete Hebrew Bible by a Jew. The impetus for Leeser throughout was always his desire to provide the Jews of America with an English text of the Bible that was produced by one of their own and was not tainted by conversionist motivations. In the preface to the first volume, Leeser could not be any plainer in his declaration that ""however much a revised translation may be desired by all believers in the Word of God, there is no probability that the gentiles will encourage any publication of this nature, emanating from a Jewish writer,"" a revealing comment on the contemporary state of Jewish-Christian relations in the America of 1845. <u>Literature</u>: Rosenbach 569; Singerman 884; Goldman7; Lance J.

As a young man with few prospects in Europe, he arrived in the United States in 1824 and went to work for an uncle in Richmond, Virginia.In 1828 he took the first step that would launch his career as a religious leader and writer, and published his first article, a defense of Judaism against a defamatory piece which had appeared in a New York newspaper. The essay attracted wide notice and in 1829 the Sephardi congregation, Mikveh Israel of Philadelphia, invited him to be its hazzan . Over the next four decades Leeser's list of accomplishments on behalf of American Jewry would grow quite long: founder of the first successful Jewish newspaper in America (1843); founder of the Jewish Publication Society (1845); publisher of the first Hebrew primer for children (1838), the first complete English translation of the Sephardi prayer book (1848), and numerous other Jewish children's textbooks; founder of the first Hebrew high school (1849); first Jewish representative and defense organization, the Board of Delegates of American Israelites (1859), founder of Maimonides College, the first American rabbinical seminary (1867). Of all his accomplishments, however, it was his role as the pioneer Jewish preacher in the United States that was closest to his heart. It has even been written of Leeser, that ""hewas totally enamored with the idea of Jewish preaching."" Volumes 1 and 2 of Leeser's Discourses were first published in 1837, volume 3 in 1841. The complete set in ten volumes which comprise the present lot, was printed in 1867. Though Isaac Leeser initially delivered these sermons for the benefit of his congregants, his decision to print this ten-volume anthology was motivated primarily by the recognition that it would serve as his lasting legacy for a ""new generation that has sprung up."" Judge Mayer Sulzberger reflected on the greater implications of the monumental work: ""[This book] indeed will be one of the main sources for a history of Judaism in our country . . . Every Jew who is interested in the events that have befallen his co-religionists here, during the last forty years . . . will be glad to possess the work."" Judge Sulzberger's words have proven true. Although he was a strong proponent of traditional Judaism and rejected the innovations of the growing Reform movement in the United States, Isaac Leeser's influence nevertheless impacted the entire American Jewish community. His work laid the foundations for many of the key institutions of present-day Jewish life and his contributions to nearly every area of Jewish culture and religion define him as one of the seminal figures in the history of the development of American Judaism. Perhaps nowhere can the measure of the man and his milieu be better perceived than in the pages of his Discourses . <u>Literature</u>: Singerman, 1956; Lance Sussman, Isaac Leeser and the Making of American Judaism, Wayne State University Press, 1996."1193,17-Dec-13,judaica-n09060,Important Judaica,USD,['Americana'],"MINHAG AMERICA; TEFILOT B&#39;NAI YESHURUN, ISAAC MAYER WISE, CINCINNATI: BLOCH,...",15000,156,TRUE,12000,['Printed'],12500,,['Religion'],2013,"318 pp (6 1/4 in.; 158 x 102 mm). <u>pagination:</u> German:[v], 6-171, [i] and Hebrew: [vii] 6-144.

Largely retaining the format of the traditional siddur, Wise made modifications to reflect ""the wants and demands of time"", including changing the Hebrew word goel (redeemer) to geulah (redemption), reflecting a removal of references to a personal Messiah. The prayer book retained many portions of the traditional Hebrew language text, while adding concise and accurate translations into the vernacular. Minhag America eliminated calls for a return to the Land of Israel, the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, the reinstitution of sacrifices, the restoration of the priesthood and the primacy of the Davidic dynasty. References to resurrection were changed to reflect a spiritual immortality. The prayer book was accepted by the majority of Reform congregations in United States and remained the standard siddur until the publication of the Union Prayer Book in the 1890s.

He played a central role in the founding of three major Reform Jewish institutions that still exist today: The Union of American Hebrew Congregations in 1873 (now the Union for Reform Judaism, the parent body of Reform synagogues); the Hebrew Union College in 1875 (the Reform movement's rabbinical seminary); and the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1889 (the Reform rabbinical association.) One of the preeminent photographers of his day,James Landy (1838-1897) was a New York native who built up a flourishing portrait business in downtown Cincinnati during and after the Civil War.

Mrs. Esther Levy attempted to demonstrate that fine dining could be achieved while still adhering to the laws of kashrut. Indeed, in her introduction Mrs. Levy pointedly notes that, ""without violating the precepts of our religion, a table can be spread, which will satisfy the appetites of the most fastidious."" This volume is a fascinating culinary and historical document that offers housekeeping and domestic management advice, as well as daily menu suggestions, a Jewish calendar, and even a selection of medical and household recipes. Mrs. Levy opens her work with a brief review of the basic laws associated with a kosher home including the soaking and salting of meat, and an outline of the arrangements that are necessary to prepare a home for the Passover holiday. She continues with tips on how to arrange a table and which dishes are to be served at every course. A large selection of recipes follows including chapters on fish, soups, meats, breads, preserves, pickles, cheese and wines. A chapter on food for the sick suggests medicinal recipes for fainting and diphtheria. At the end of the book Mrs. Levy provides her reader with miscellaneous household cleaning tips including how to clean silk and ribbons, how to wash a black lace veil, how to cement broken china, how to preserve gilding, how to concoct a good bug poison, and how to take out mildew. This kosher cookbook, the first of its kind printed in America, allowed Jewish women of the period to serve meals with panache while maintaining elegant yet kosher homes. <u>Literature</u>: Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, ""The Kosher Gourmet in the Nineteenth-Century Kitchen: Three Jewish Cookbooks in Historical Perspective.""

He was commissioned to create works for Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson as well as numerous other religious and political figures. Created for use in a synagogue, this magnificently illuminated plaque presents the blessings to be recited before and after the reading of the Torah so that worshippers who are called to the Torah may recite these required texts. Embellished with gold highlights, the brilliantly-colored border design features eight charming miniature illustrations representing the Sabbath and festivals. This truly unique combination of an illuminated text and its beautiful silver housing make the present lot a rare example of a ritual object which stands out as a decorative piece of synagogue furnishing, in its own right. Among Nodels most important commissions was the work he created forthe multi-volume, monumental artists'Haggadah , known asthe Rose Family Seder Books , annually displayed at the New York Public Library. Comprising more than sixty years of Passover-themed artwork, each year, an outstanding artist has been commissioned to add to the ongoing project, .

In fact the circumcision itself is preceded by the pronouncement: ""This is the chair of Elijah, blessed be his memory."" An Elijahs chair is usually paired with a second matching chair reserved for the sandak , who holds the baby during the ritual. Though there are regional differences in the chair's structural style, size and decoration, a chair designated to be used as a Chair of Elijah is usually much finer than chairs used in daily life: ornately carved, painted or upholstered in especially beautiful fabric. Each gilt-framed chair back is copiously decorated with sumptuous metallic thread embroidery on a red velvet ground. Each features an elaborate embroidered border of flowering vines, with roses and pinecones; within the border, embroidered Hebrew text, above which are traditional Jewish symbols associated with the circumcision rite. On the first chairback: a circumcision shield flanked by the two halves of a traditional double wine-cup used as a part of the circumcision ceremony (labeled kos shel berakha and kos shel metzitza ). On the second chairback: a crown is depicted bearing the legend: Crown of a Good Name (Ethics of the Fathers, 4:13), alluding to the portion of the ceremony in which the newly circumcised child is named for the first time. The embroidered text begins on the first panel: Gift of the community leader, his honor Rabbi Gedalia Charlevil, may God protect him, and his wife, Madame Brendl, daughter of his honor, Rabbi Abraham; The text continues on the second panel: For the elevation of the soul of his departed father, the community leader, his honor Rabbi Simon, son of the community leader Jacob Charlevil, may the memory of the righteous be for a blessing, who was among those who laid the cornerstone of the synagogue of our community, in The Hague, may God protect it, which was established on Tuesday, the 25<sup>th</sup> of Nisan, [5]603, according to the minor reckoning. (= 25 April 1843). Both Gedalia Charlevil and his wife Brendl (ne Berendina van Gelder) were born in the Netherlands in 1899 and married in The Hague in 1842. The Charlevil family may have had its origins in the French city of the same name, but by the mid-nineteenth century, they were important pillars of the Jewish community in The Hague, as may be ascertained from the fact that Simon Charlevil is memorialized in this embroidered inscription as one of those who laid the synagogue cornerstone. Today, the same building houses a mosque, though the original cornerstone engraved in both Hebrew and Dutch is still visible at street level. It reads: ""The first stone of the construction of the sanctuary of God, this Ashkenazi congregation Yeshurun , the holy congregation of The Hague, may God defend it, which was placed on Tuesday, the 25th of Nissan, 5603 [1843]."""1265,17-Dec-13,judaica-n09060,Important Judaica,USD,['Judaica'],"AN EXCEPTIONALLY FINE EMBROIDED TALLIT, ITALY OR WESTERN EUROPE, SECOND...",15000,82,FALSE,10000,['Textile'],11250,,['Fabric design'],2013,"Finely and elaborately embroidered in a variety of stitches, including drawn work, satin stitch, long and short stitching, running stitches, couching, feather stitches andFrench knots. 56.7 by 68.7 in. 144 by 174.5 cm.

In the Jewish tradition, the Ark of the Covenant was built to house the sacred Tablets of the Law, first in the Sanctuary in the wilderness and subsequently in the Holy Temple of Jerusalem. Based on this paradigmatic exemplar, the Jewish people have throughout their long and storied history, continued the tradition of encasing sacred scriptures within special containers. To this day, every synagogue keeps its sacred scrolls in a Torah Ark designated solely for that purpose. It has always been common practice to adorn these enclosures with verses from the Scriptures themselves. Photographic evidence from the last century reveals that the verse carved on this frieze was also carved on an ark door (no longer extant)in the famousBen Ezra Synagogue in Cairo.

The largest part of the present manuscript (253 leaves) comprises the work known as Kamil al-Sinaa (also known as Kitab al-Maliki ) by Ali ibn al-Abbas al-Madjusi (d. ca. 985), which served as a primarytextbook for medical students. Though Arabic copies are not uncommon, only three other copies written in Hebrew characters are known.The manuscript also includes part of the Book of Ilnesses and Symptoms, a titlelisted among the works of Galen. The colophon of this work states that it was copiedby Abu-l-Hasan Saad ibn Hibat Allah forDavid ben Shalom, in the year 1448in Catania, a Sicilian town where the the presence of Jews is already attested to in 383 CE. Many of the references to the Jews of Catania in later centuries indicate the presence of numerous physicians. For other similar multicultural medical anthologies, see Steinschneider, Die Arabische Literatur der Juden , 1902, pp. 213221. ""One reason for this devotion of Jews to medicine was that the study of medical science was looked upon as a sort of religious duty"" ( Jewish Chronicle , 19 November 1926, p. 17). Yet despite the importance of medicine in medieval Jewish learning, medical manuscripts are of extreme rarity.Furthermore, this manuscript is the only surviving text written in Hebrew characters from the ancient Jewish community of the Sicilian port city of Catania. The earliest presence of Jews in Catania is attested to by a lengthy Jewish tombstone inscription dating from the year 383 CE. Many of the references to the Jews of Catania in the subsequent centuries refer to Jewish medical practitioners, among them a Jewish woman who in 1376 obtained a license to practice medicine throughout Sicily. In 1455, near the time this manuscript was written, Jews from Catania and other towns in Sicily attempted to immigrate to Jerusalem but were discovered by the authorities and punished. When the Jews of Catania were finally expelled in 1492 along with the rest of Sicilian Jewry, this manuscript was likely carried into exile with them. Sotheby's is extremely grateful to Dr. Menahem Schmelzer for providing information which aided in the cataloging of this lot.

After moving to St. Petersburg and studying at the Imperial Academy of Arts under Mikhail Klodt, the young artist traveled extensively throughout the mountain ranges of Europe and the Caucasus before settling in Tiflis. Bashinzhagyan's works reflect the influences of fellow artist and friend Ivan Aivazovsky, whom he visited frequently, and he became one of the most beloved artists of Armenia. Martiros Saryan once proclaimed, ""Bashinzhagyan is a great portrayer of the Caucuses. He is keenly responsive to the grandeur and beauty of its mountains, canyons, and valleys, and left us many unforgettable canvases."" Several of his masterpieces are held in museum collections, including the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow and the National Gallery of Armenia in Yerevan."1312,9-Oct-13,impressionist-modern-art-n09022,Impressionist &amp; Modern Art,USD,['Russian'],ALEXEI STEPANOVICH STEPANOV,40000,131,TRUE,30000,"['Oil', 'Painting', 'Canvas', 'Oil on canvas']",37500,THE VILLAGE SWING,"['Children', 'Figure', 'Landscape']",2013,"Signed in Cyrillic (lower left) Oil on canvas 30 by 45 3/4 in. 76.2 by 116.2 cm Provenance  Russian Art Exhibition The Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh Acquired through the above by the family of the present owner Thence by descent"1313,9-Oct-13,impressionist-modern-art-n09022,Impressionist &amp; Modern Art,USD,['Russian'],LÉON BAKST,12000,132,TRUE,8000,"['Paper', 'Body colour/gouache', 'Works on paper', 'Pencil']",15000,COSTUME DESIGN FOR A FAIRY FROM THE BALLET THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,['Figure'],2013,"Signed Bakst and dated 1916 (lower right) Gouache, watercolor, silver paint and pencil on paper laid down on cardboard 13 1/8 by 6 5/8 in. 33.3 by 16.8 cm Executed in 1916.

This arrangement of biblical textwas exceedingly rare in the medieval period, although today it is much more common. It is, in nearly every case,virtually impossible to identify the scribe who produced a particular Torah Scroll, especially one which is more than 700 years old. Incredibly however, we may have an indirect hint to the identity of our scribe based on an extraordinary conflation of textual clues. Several leading Ashkenazic rabbinic authorities of the second half of the 13th century including the Maharam of Rothenberg (ca. 12151293), inveighed against the writing of Torah scrolls in this fashion ( vavei haamudim ), because it was felt that the average scribe would be unable to produce an aesthetically pleasing scroll with such a layout. Given the stature of the Maharam in 13th century Ashkenaz, the notion that his ruling would be ignored, would be inconceivable. We are fortunate however to have the testimony of the Maharams pupil, Rabbi Meir ben Yekutiel ha-Kohen (d. 1298), author of Hagahot Maimuniyot , who notes, <u>in the name of his teacher</u>, that there was in fact one such expert scribe, a certain Leontin of Mulhausen, who was able to produce a Torah Scroll in which the vavei haamudim configuration was executed in an aesthetically pleasing manner (see Hagahot Maimuniyot , Hilkhot Sefer Torah 7:9, note 7). Though there is no way to know for certain, we may nevertheless speculate that the present Torah Scroll, may in fact be the work of Leontin of Mulhasen. Interestingly, a number of scribes in the 14th century produced codices (rather than scrolls) with such a layout (some with 48 lines per column, and some with 60 lines per column). However, the present lot represents the earliest example of a Torah scroll with such a layout.

Catalogue Note <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-wrap""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-text""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-holder""> Moses Maimonides (11351204), rabbinic authority, codifier, philosopher, and royal physician was the most illustrious figure in Judaism in the post-talmudic era. Frequently referred to as Rambam (an acronym for Rabbi Moses Ben Maimon,) Maimonides, was born in Cordoba, Spain but was forced to flee in 1148 as a result of religious persecution. Maimonides eventually settled in Egypt, where he was named court physician to al-Fail. In 1177 he was recognized as the official head of the Fostat community and his contemporaries referred to him in glowing terms as ""the light of east and west and unique master and marvel of the generation."" It was during this exceptionally productive period of his life, that he wrote the two monumental works upon which his fame chiefly rests, the Mishneh Torah (ca. 1180) and the Guide to the Perplexed (ca. 1190). Throughout his adult life Maimonides maintained a special relationship with the Jews of Yemen. When a false messiah arose, existentially threatening the survival of the Yemeni Jewish community, they turned in their hour of need to Maimonides, who replied in a consolatory epistle entitled ""Iggeret Teman."" This literary tour de force not only inspired them to withstand the current crisis; it left an indelible impression on the Jews of Yemen and afforded Maimonides a nearly saint-like status in their eyes. This led, even in Maimonides lifetime, to widespread promulgation and copying of the sages written works among Yemenite Jews. These early Yemenite manuscripts provide us with the most authoritative and most accurate versions of the Rambams words. Rabbi Yosef Kapach (19172000), was one of the foremost leaders of the Yemenite Jewish community, first in Yemen and later in Israel. He is best known for his editions and translations of the works of Maimonides and other early rabbinic authorities, primarily his restoration of the Mishneh Torah from old manuscripts. His extensive personal collection of ancient manuscripts of Maimonides works, from which these leaves emanate, is legendary. ""When in my youth I studied the Mishneh Torah with my grandfather of blessed memory[he] had manuscripts which were several hundred years old, each scroll of a different age. The errors and deficiencies of the printed texts were well known. So much so that the printed books were used to characterize a mistaken person -- when someone said something incorrect on some subject, they would respond ""you are like a printed text,"" and point out the correction. These matters were inscribed on my heart, and I grew up with the assumption that there were two types of Maimonides texts in the world: that of the Yemenite manuscripts and that of the printed book. With study and investigation over time, I realized that there were very many differences of various kinds between the Yemenite manuscripts and the printed texts We have a tradition from our ancestors, and my grandfather wrote about it in one of his letters, that even during the life of Maimonides, the Jews of Yemen sent expert copyists to Egypt to make copies of his manuscripts. And from time to time they sent for updates and corrections to their books according to the most recent emendations and reconciliations of Maimonides, including the very latestThis is not just a matter of oral tradition, but there is a provable reliable basis for it.

Tosafot Gornish , composed in the 14th century, is the earliest example of the highly controversial style of Talmud study known as pilpul . This particular collection of Tosafistic material is extant in only a very few manuscripts, scattered in a handful of libraries around the world. Furthermore, these few manuscripts provide commentary to only a small fraction of the hundreds of chapters in the Babylonian Talmud. The text of the present manuscript is believed to comprise the Tosafot Gornish on the opening chapters of Tractate Ketubbot ,and isunknown from any other source. Professor Israel Ta-Shma draws a possible connection between Tosafot Gornish and the concurrent increase in the penetration of philosophical writings into the broader society in general and among Ashkenazic Jewry in particular. Though different theories have been advanced with regard to the meaning and origin of the word Gornish , Ta-Shma cites an early reference to guri or gurin (indicating combativeness) as the most likely possibility. Earlier scholars suggested a geographical meaning and posited etymological similarities between Gornish and certain Ashkenazic place names.

The first section, Helek ha-Dikduk (grammar) retained that title, while the second section, Helek ha-Inyan (lexicon), would become known as Sefer ha-Shorashim , a glossary of Hebrew and Aramaic words. The title derives from the layout of the text, where the root letters of individual words are written in large bold letters followed by philological explanations and biblical citations.

These""tax-farmers"" would, for a specified lump sum paid tothe treasury,exact the payments due from the taxpayers. Of course, the risks of undercollection were, as a rule, more than made up by the potential of the considerable surpluses that could beobtained. So indispensable were the Spanish Jewish tax farmers that the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella,continued to sign four-year contracts for the collection of taxes, with Jewishentrepreneurs as late as 1491, only a year before they expelled the Jews from Spain. The community of Segovia was one of the most important in Castile, and achieved great prosperity in the 13th century. When the persecutions of 1391 broke out, the Segovian authorities were unable to protect the Jews, and the community never attained its former grandeur. Anti-Jewish activity came to a head at the close of the 1480s even as the community grew in size, due to the arrival of Jews expelled from Andalusia."1587,19-Dec-12,judaica-n08922,Important Judaica,USD,['Continental books and manuscripts'],ESTHER SCROLL [SPAIN: 14TH-15TH CENTURY],15000,113,FALSE,12000,['Manuscripts'],10000,,['Religion'],2012,"1 scroll (6 1/2 x 90 1/8 in.; 166 x 2290 mm).

The ancient tradition of writing this work in scroll format remains in effect to this day and among Jews, the book of Esther is commonly referred to as a megillah, a Hebrew. The dating and localizing of Esther scrolls is, for the most part based on paleography, the study of different scripts, and codicology, the physical characteristics of a given book or scroll. In this case, the use of a classic Sephardic script and the distinctive light brown ink typically used by Hebrew scribes in Spain and Portugal are among the factors that have led scholars to conclude that this scroll emanates from the Iberian Peninsula. In light of the expulsions of the Jews from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1497, the survival of any Hebrew text from this period is exceptionally rare.

In 1564 he began to study Kabbalah, according to the system of Moses Cordovero. After Isaac Luria's arrival in Safed, Vital became his principal disciple, studying under him for nearly two years until Luria's death in the summer of 1572. Vitals most enduring accomplishment was his subsequent arrangement of Luria's teachings in written form, often accompanied by his own elaborations, a task which took him some twenty years. Before his association with Luria, however, Vital had undertaken an important work, Sefer Etz ha-Da'at which demonstrated his affinity towards and command of Cordovero's teachings.Only parts of this work which included commentaries on most of the books of the Bible, remain extant . Vitals methodology was organized under the rubric Pardes (literally: orchard, but actually an acronym formed by the initial letters of the four traditional ways of explicating sacred texts: ( peshat , ""the literal meaning""; remez , ""the allegorical meaning""; derash , the exegetical meaning, and sod , the mystical or esoteric meaning.) Despite conflicting internal references, most scholars agree that Vital composed the bulk of this work before the age of twenty. It had long been believed that only chapters 2 and 6 of this work were preserved in Vitals own hand, and it was from these fragments that the work was published. (in the collection of Rabbi Alter of Gur [MS # 185] and in a second part preserved in the kabbalistic yeshivah Bet-El).

In order to offset the expense of the manuscript and to help facilitate the costs of publication of the previously unknown words of Hayyim Vital, several pages, including the present lot,werewere sold privately.

Zechariah Aldahiri (c. 15191585) composed this work in 1568, while incarcerated along with the rest of the Sanaa Jewish community by the Muslim authorities, who suspected the Jews of sympathizing with the forces of the Ottoman occupation. Sefer ha-Musar is written in elevated and exuberant rhymed prose, rife with puns and scriptural verse fragments cleverly lifted out of context, and interspersed with metrical poems. Its language is largely biblical Hebrew, though Aldahiri also draws freely on rabbinic and medieval Hebrew as well as talmudic Aramaic. Composed of forty-five self-contained chapters, or maqamat (Hebrew: mahbarot ), the work is at once didactic and delightfully entertaining, soberly instructive and hilariously diverting. In Yehuda Ratzabys introduction to the critical edition, he demonstrates the importance of Sefer ha-Musar as a source for the political, intellectual, and cultural history of eastern Jewish communities in the 16th century, particularly those of Yemen and the Land of Israel.

Because Luria himself wrote almost nothing during his lifetime, the corpus of Lurianic literature is highly complex and disorganized. Most of what exists from the Safed circle is the product of various students, the most prolific and prominent being Haim Vital and Derekh Etz Haim is his magnum opus and one of the foundational texts in the Lurianic corpus. First edited by Vitals son Samuel, the final redaction of Vital's writing was arranged by Meir Poppers (1624-1662) a disciple of Jacob Zemach. The first printed edition appeared in Korets in 1782, more than half a century after the present manuscript was written. Outside of certain traditional mystical diagrams, charts and figures, most Kabbalistic manuscripts are typically, by their nature, devoid of decoration and illustration. This manuscript however,penned by a professional scribe in an elegant and meticulous Ashkenazic semi-cursive script, features a decorated or illustrated initial word panel for nearly every one of its 50 chapters. While these are mostly executed in ink, a dozen feature the addition of colors. Some of these panels depict architectural motifs alluding to the gates or chapter divisions, into which the book is divided; others provide a wide variety of figural illustrations and some geometric decorations; eight kabbalistic diagrams and one kabbalistic chart are also present. The extensive marginalia bear witness to the fact that in addition to its physical beauty, the manuscript has been studied assiduously. The elaborate decorative program of this early eighteenth century manuscript, is unparalled. Rabbi Yosef Avivi, one of the worlds foremost authorities on the writings of the Luria and his students, writes of this manuscript: More than 150 manuscripts of Derekh Etz Haim have passed before my eyes, and I have not seen a single copy as beautifully illustrated and decorated.

Despite the presence of copies of Sefer ha-Kavanot in a number of manuscript collections, the present manuscript represents an important and unique version, unknown from any other source. Edited and arranged independently by the scribe himself, the manuscript includes numerous passages explaining the exclusion or inclusion of specific material, based on its availability either in print or in other manuscript volumes to which the scribe had access (see for example ff. 132v, 135r, 144v, 157r, 158r, 238v, 241v, 261v). The material in this manuscript is arranged in gates, chapters, and sub-headings, rather than the continuous uninterrupted text found in other versions.

The scribe and artist of this manuscript, Aaron Wolff Herlingen, was one of the finest Jewish calligraphers of this 18th-century renaissance of Hebrew manuscripts. Herlingen was active from 1719 to 1752, primarily in Vienna. Herlingen signed his name on the title-page of the present manuscript in no fewer than four languages: Hebrew, Latin, German and French, a conspicuous demonstration of his facility in the multiple languages of the Austrian Empire. In 1736, six years after this manuscript was completed, Herlingen was appointed scribe to the Imperial Library in Vienna. More than forty manuscripts signed by Herlingen are extant and approximately a dozen more are attributed to him. These include miniature prayerbooks, circumcision books, and Esther scrolls, as well as several Haggadot. The present haggadah is one of Herlingen's finest efforts. His consummate skill is evidenced equally in the superbly written letters of the text and commentaries, the charmingly executed, inhabited initials and decorated initial word panels, and in the finely drawn illustrations, which Herlingen modeled after the highly popular copperplate engravings found in the Amsterdam haggadah of 1695. The decorative elements within this manuscript consist of an elaborate decorated title page, three ornamented initial word panels (fols 3v, 18r, 20r), and 60 text illustration; 50 illustrations executed in grisaille with modeling achieved through subtle gray washes,and a further 10 illustrations painted in color. Additionally, Herlingen makes use of delicate and playful inhabited letters to highlight an important passage of the text (fol. 22r). <u>The Map </u> The highly detailed manuscript map appended to this haggadah is the original creation of Herlingen, created specifically for this volume in 1730, as can be seen from the explanatory text located at the upper left side of the map. This unique text offers us an exceptional and unparalleled glimpse into the creative process of the foremost scribe/artist of the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Herlingen states that he traveled to Pressburg and produced the map there in consultation with Rabbi Abraham Fleckeles, who like Herlingen, was aware of the many geographical and cartographic deficiencies in the 1695 printed map of the Amsterdam haggadah, which had been drawn by Abraham bar Jacob, and was in turn, based on an earlier map by the 16th-century cartographer Christian van Adrichom. According to Herlingen, his map delineates more accurately the route of the Exodus and correctly depicts the portions of the Twelve Tribes in the Land of Israel. Below the explanatory text is a list of the 42 stations visited by the Children of Israel during their 40-year peregrination in the desert. The current work precedes, by more than six decades, the only other known example of an eighteenth century manuscript haggadah with an appended map <u>Illustrations: </u> Folio 1r: Text set within an architectural framework ; flanking the text, at left, Moses supporting the Tablets of the Law with one hand and the matteh (Moses' staff) in the other; at right, Aaron, garbed as High Priest, holds a censer. Above them, the Clouds of Glory, surmounted by two cherubs supporting a blank cartouche (presumably meant for an owner's inscription). Set within another cartouche, below the text, a vignette, captioned: ""In the merit of the righteous women, the Israelites were delivered from Egypt"" (Sotah 11b). According to rabbinic lore, despite the grueling conditions of slavery and Pharaohs decree that all male children be killed, the Israelite women persevered to maintain Jewish continuity. When they went to draw water, small fish would enter their pitchers (seen at left). The women cooked the fish and brought the meal to their husbands, toiling in the fields, and seduced them into engaging in marital relations. When the time for childbirth arrived, the women again went out to the fields and delivered beneath the apple trees (seen at center). After the children were born, God provided sustenance for the infants (seen at right). <u> Folio 1v: </u> Three illustrations of a family performing the first three elements of the Seder ritual: Kadesh (sanctification of the wine), Urhatz (washing of the hands) Karpas (vegetable dipped into salt water) <u> Folio 2r: </u> Final nine illustrations of the order of the Seder ritual: Yahatz (splitting the matzah) Maggid (recitation of the haggadah) Rahtzah (second washing of the hands) Motzee-Matzah (blessings over the matzah) Maror (bitter herbs) Korekh (matzah with bitter herbs) Shulhan Oreikh (the Passover Meal) Zafun-Bareikh ( afikomen and Grace after the Meal) Hallel-Nirzah (concluding psalms and songs). <u> Folio 3v: </u> Ornamented initial word panel set within a cartouche supported by two winged horses <u> Folio 5r: </u> The Sages at Benei Brak <u> Folio 6r: </u> The Four Sons <u> Folio 7r: </u> Abraham destroying the idols <u> Folio 8r: </u> The angels visiting Abraham and Sarah <u> Folio 9r: </u> Moses leading the Exodus from Egypt <u> Folio 10r: </u> Moses slaying the EgyptianIsraelites building the cities of Pithom and Ramses <u> Folio 11r: </u> Pharaoh's daughter rescuing Moses from the Nile <u> Folio 11v </u>: Moses and Aaron performing miracles before Pharaoh <u> Folio 12v: </u> The first through fifth plagues: blood, frogs, lice, beasts, murrain (5 color illustrations) <u>Folio 13r:</u> The sixth through tenth plagues: boils, hail, locusts, darkness, slaying of the firstborn (5 color illustrations) <u>Folio 14r:</u> The Egyptians drowning in the Red Sea as the Israelites watch from the shore <u>Folio 15v:</u> The Israelites at Mount Sinai receiving the Ten Commandments <u>Folio 16v:</u> Decorative initial words: Pesah, Matzah, Maror <u> Folio 18r:</u> An entire paragraph executed in hatched letters <u>Folio 19r:</u> A distinctly imaginative initial word panel for Grace after Meals. The letters of the initial word Barukh are individually framed and inhabited by figures of birds and animals executed in extremely fine penwork against a background of scrolling vines and in the case of the final letter, a diminutive cityscape; the menagerie includes a stag, a hare, a sheep, a lion, an eagle, a bear, a stork and a rather charming, cello-playing monkey. <u> Folio 21r: </u> The initial word Shefokh , set within a panel which includes two putti bearing shields inscribed with the four expressions ( ve-hozeiti, vehizalti, ve-goalti, ve-lakachti ) used in the book of Exodus (6:6-7) to describe Gods beneficence to the Children of Israel. Here too Herlingen demonstrates his artistic skills, using trompe loeil technique to extend the legs of the putti beyond the frame. <u> Folio 22r: </u> In a scribal tour de force, Herlingen has penned four verses of the Hodu text (Psalms 118:1-4), in extraordinary miniature inhabited letters. One letter even includes a minuscule rendition of Adam and Eve being tempted by the Serpent. This decorative style of lettering was popular in medieval Hebrew manuscripts. <u> Folio 29r: </u> The Third Temple within the walls of a rebuilt Jerusalem, in the messianic era; also, an illustration for the first verse of ehad mi yodea (Who Knows One) <u> Folio 29v: </u> Illustrations for verses 2-5 of ehad mi yodea <u> Folio 30r: </u> Illustrations for verses 6-8 of ehad mi yodea <u>Folio 30v:</u> Illustrations for verses 9-12 of ehad mi yodea <u> Folio 31r: </u> Illuutration for the final (13<sup>th</sup>) verse of ehad mi yodea ; illustrations for verses 1-4 of had gadya (An Only Kid) <u> Folio 31v: </u> Illustrations for verses 5-9 of had gadya. <u> Folio 32r: </u> Illustration for the final (10<sup>th</sup>) verse of had gadya <u> Folio 33r: </u> An elaborately penned map of the Land of Israel, executed in back, brown and red ink, with highlights colored in yellow, red and green gouache. This exquisite manuscript was, for over a century (1781-1883), passed down as a family heirloomin the hands of the illustrious Banet family of Moravian rabbis and scholars. Theregister of births and deaths inscribed on the flyleafof the manuscript includes a particularly poignant pair of entries which mark the birth of a young man, Koppel Banet, in 1809, and seven decades later, record his death in 1879, underscoring the multigenerational nature of this register. These kinds of important family data were traditionally recorded in the most important volume in a familys possession; the one most likely to be saved and preserved as one generation made way for the next.

Catalogue Note <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-wrap""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-text""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-holder""> <u>an homage to the 18th-century tradition of hebrew manuscript illumination</u> In the early 18th century, long after the art of the handmade illuminated book had declined in the broader Jewish society, some influential Court Jews and other members of the new class of Jewish bourgeoisie in German-speaking lands began to commission luxurious individual Hebrew manuscripts. Based upon the number of extant copies, the illustrated Haggadah was the most popular book produced by a cadre of talented scribe/artists whose ranks included: Joseph Leipnik, Aaron Wolf Helringen, Nathan ben Shimshon of Meseritz, and Meshullam Zimmel of Polna. Some of the most beautiful works emanating from this period, known as the Renaissance of Hebrew manuscript production, were the minuscule volumes created by these gifted artisans. These palm-sized treasures, often heavily laden with numerous illustrations and lavishly bound in precious materials, served specific liturgical functions, as prayerbooks or haggadot, and the like. They also provided their owners with portable symbols of wealth; a way to tangibly display their affluence while remaining safely within the confines of the Jewish milieu. Following this 18<sup>th</sup> century burst of artistic creativity however, the art of the handmade and illuminated Haggadah once again went into a state of precipitous decline. The title page of this incredibly charming miniature haggadah clearly states the scribes intention to emulate these masterpieces: Haggadah for Passover, with pleasing illustrations, gathered from a variety of ancient haggadot, which I have caressed and cherished, I the insignificant, Haim Leib Bienhacker in honor of the Prince, the Excellent, our Teacher, Rabbi Yekutiel Fishof. Whereas the eighteenth century scribe/artists had used as their model, primarily the imagery of the printed haggadah of Amsterdam and the copperplate engravings of Jacob ben Abraham, Haim Leib Bienhacker elected to use as his model the artistic program that had first appeared in print nearly two centuries earlier. In 1609, a Haggadah of singular beauty was published in Venice by Israel ben David Zifroni, a veteran printer and copy editor of Hebrew books in Italy and Switzerland. Dozens of woodcut illustrations of the Passover ritual often executed as miniature vignettes provided a striking visual imagery. The haggadah, printed in three versions (Judeo-German [Yiddish], Judeo-Italian, and Judeo-Spanish [Ladino]), proved exceedingly popular and the durability of the basic design is confirmed by its subsequent reprinting in 1629, 1663, 1695, 1716 and 1740. With the close of the era of Venetian Hebrew printing at the end of the 18th century, the iconography was transferred wholesale to the Livornese haggadah of 1837, and in turn reprised in numerous subsequent haggadot The images used here by Bienhacker are primarily drawn from this well-loved series of Italian haggadot that have helped to illustrate the Passover Haggadah and spark the imaginations of Jews around the world for more than 400 years. To further beautify and adorn this miniature volume, it has been placed in an exquisite silver binding produced in Rome in the 19th century. The heavily embossed binding bears the coat of arms of the renowned Fiorentini family. This family of Tuscan origin has been in Rome since the 16th century and included poets (Salamone), and several generations of Italian warriors who distinguished themselves in military service, beginning in 1867 under Garibaldi (Albert), and continuing in WW I (Albert), and in the resistance to the Nazis in WW II (Mario). The present manuscript, meticulously lettered and painstakingly illustrated, housed in a majestic and luxurious binding in conscious imitation of the traditions of the 18th century Court Jews, exemplifies a dedication and devotion to both faith and art, which stakes out this volumes unique place along the continuum of haggadah production that has spanned millennia."1601,19-Dec-12,judaica-n08922,Important Judaica,USD,"['Other', 'Continental books and manuscripts']","OMER CALENDAR, HOLLAND: EARLY 18TH CENTURY",70000,126,FALSE,50000,"['Manuscripts', 'Other']",50000,,['Other'],2012,"Ink and gouache on parchment, fitted in a wood and glass cabinet with internal rollers and four decorative turning knobs(height of scroll 10 in.: 265 mm; overall dimensions of cabinet 20 x 21 x 5 in).

Kettubot from this Ionian island in the Aegean Sea often include some of the earliest traditions of written ketubbot, as seen in this example. The dual dating system uses both the traditional method of counting the years since Creation as well as an enumeration of years since the destruction of the Second Temple. Another unusual tradition is the inclusion of a clause wherein the bride undertakes to honor and serve him [the groom] in cleanliness and purity, as decent and modest Jewish women honor and serve their husbands. This clause, written in Hebrew in the midst of the Aramaic text, is reminiscent of early medieval ketubbot from the Land of Israel. In 1863, when the Kingdom of Greece annexed the island of Corfu, the Jewish community numbered 6,000 (just over 9% of the local population). However, in 1864, anti-Jewish riots broke out, initiating a large exodus of Jews to Greece and Italy."1609,19-Dec-12,judaica-n08922,Important Judaica,USD,"['Other', 'Continental books and manuscripts']","A COLLECTION OF THREE DECORATED MARRIAGE CONTRACTS FROM VIDIN, BULGARIA:...",12000,133,TRUE,10000,['Manuscripts'],17500,,"['Art', 'Documents', 'Religion']",2012,"A.

Because its reasoning is direct, and largely based on human experience, Pirkei Avot is the most accessible of the books making up the Oral Law. The custom of studying Avot on the Sabbath, spread from geonic Babylonia to Jewish communities all over the globe and led to this broad familiarity with the text. The frequent rereading and studying of the text may help to explain the scarcity of surviving copies of the first edition. The commentary on the Mishnah was the earliest of Maimonides' major writings.

Both his father and brother were accomplished grammarians in their own right and Kimhi's own philological writings would owe a great deal to their early influence. This work was originally part of a longer grammatical treatise, called Mikhlol . The first section, Helek ha-Dikduk (grammar) retained the title Mikhlol , while the second section, Helek ha-Inyan (lexicon), would become known as Sefer ha-Shorashim , a glossary of Hebrew and Aramaic words. The title derives from the layout of the text, where the root letters of individual words are printed in large bold letters followed by philological explanations and biblical citations. It was due to the popularity of both Mikhlol and Sefer ha-Shorashim that most of the works of Kimhi's predecessors fell into disuse. Circulating in manuscripts for more than three centuries after his death, Kimhi's philological writings became the primary grammatical text for the study of Hebrew and biblical vocabulary for centuries to come. With the advent of printing, Sefer ha-Shorashim was brought to press three times during the 15th century alone, first in Rome, and twice in Naples. As a result, Kimhi's work became readily accessible to a much broader constituency than he could have imagined and Sefer ha-Shorashim became the most-used reference tool for the study of biblical vocabulary through the 15th and 16th centuries for Jews and Christians alike.

The colophon however states that the work was only completed, nearly two years later, and praises the Sultan Suleiman (Selim's succesor). The death of Selim in September of 1520 and the requirement to renew permission to print under the regime of the new Sultan, may account for the length of the printing period required to complete this first editionof the Tanhuma.

Among the first works he printed in 151617 was the Mikra'ot Gedolot (Rabbinic Bible), a folio edition of the entire Bible with the leading commentaries. Pope Leo X gave his imprimatur for this book and Felix Pratensis, a monk who had been born a Jew, was the editor. Bomberg published the edition because of growing interest in the Hebrew language and the Bible among learned Christians. An adeptbusinessman, Bomberg quickly perceived that there was also a substantial market for Hebrew texts among the Jews of Italy, whose numbers had been increased by an influx of Spanish and Portuguese Jews exiled from the Iberian Peninsula. The commentaries of Rashi, Nahmanides, and Gersonides attracted the Jewish clientele, but the editorship of an apostate and the blessing of the Pope led many Jews to avoid the 1516-17 edition. Six years later, in 1524, Bomberg's second Rabbinic Bible appeared. No effort was spared to produce the finest Bible possible. It was printed in four volumes, each with its own title-page. The initial word of each book is set within a large decorative woodcut frame surrounded by a square made up of lines, varying in number, comprising the masoretic rubrics. At the end of each book is the masoretic summary. Each page is arranged in four columns, with the inner columns comprising the biblical text and the Aramaictranslation, Targum Onkelos . The outer columns contain the commentaries of Rashi and ibn Ezra. Above and below the inner columns is the Masorah Magna and in the space between these two columns is the Masorah Parva . In the narrow outer column are portions of the Masorah Parva that did not fit between the text and Targum . This time Bomberg emphasized that his printers were pious Jews, as was his scholarly editor, Jacob ben Haim ibn Adonijah. The second Rabbinic Bible became the determinative biblical text, first for Jewsand subsequently for the scholarly world as well. All future editions reflect this outstanding edition. Bomberg's press was active until 1549 and in all, more than two hundred Hebrew books were produced in his shop.

It was issued in thirteen parts, each available separately, over a period of five years between 1539-1544. One of two separate editions of the Hebrew Bible printed by Stephanus, this wide-margined quarto, is printed with several different Hebrew fonts, and clearly demonstrates the commitment of Robert Estienne to the production of beautiful Hebrew books. After finding the existing Hebrew type available to him in Parisunacceptable, Estienne had new typefaces cut for the quarto Bible byJean Arnould,considered one of the most skilled typecutters of the age. One of the first sections published in 1539 (Twelve Minor Prophets) includes the comprehensive commentary of Rabbi David Kimhi. Each of the title-pages contains both Hebrew (square and rabbinic type) and Latin, with Estienne's device, an olive tree with a man standing to the right. Between them is the phrase, Noli altum sapere (""Be not high minded,"" Romans 11:20). Towards the bottom of the page are the initial letters (in Hebrew) of the verse, My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth (Psalms 121:2). This device is one of several employed by Robert and other members of the Estienne printing dynasty. Although Estienne began the edition with the Minor Prophets in 1539, he printed the books of the Hebrew Bible out of order. The complete edition took five years to complete and as a result the first books in the traditional order of the text, which make up this volume, were the last part of the edition to come off the press, in 1543 and 1544. The binding of one of the volumes inthe present lot is made even more remarkable by the presence of Hebrew type within the blind tooling utilized by the binder. Hebrew text from Isaiah 7:14 has been used several times as a caption to one of the decorative images on the front and back covers.

The Shulhan Arukh follows the order of Jacob ben Asher's Tur and is divided into the same four parts, Orah Hayyim , Yoreh De'ah , Hoshen Mishpat , and Even ha-'Ezer. The Shulhan Arukh is an abridgement of Caro's magnum opus, the Beit Yosef. Owing to its halakhic intricacy, the Beit Yosef remained inaccessible to all but the most learned scholars. Althoughwritten to render the vast Talmudic literature more accessible and to present it in a topical and organized fashion, it is rife with extensive halakhic, theological and philosophical discussions as well as aggadic and kabbalistic content. A boon to scholars, the Beit Yosef did little to provide a ready reference to the practical application of Jewish law. Accordingly, Caro therefore composed this digestof the Beit Yosef , naming it Shulhan Arukh (Prepared Table) indicate that he had prepared the material in a manner ready to be consumed immediately. In general, Caro based his decisions on three earlier pillars of Jewish codification: the 11th-century Spanish authority Rabbi Isaac Alfasi (""Rif""), Maimonides (""Rambam"") and Rabbi Asher ben Jehiel (""Rosh,"" or ""Asheri""), the father of the Tur's compiler. In cases of disagreement among those three, Caro usually followed the majority position. Although some Rabbis initially opposed basing religious law on a summary code, rather than going back to the original legal sources, the Shulhan Arukh rapidly came to be accepted in almost all Jewish communities as the most authoritative statement of normative religious law. In recent generations, acceptance of the Shulhan Arukh has come to be regarded as a defining criterion of religious Orthodoxy and traditionalism.

From 1598 to 1796Ferrara was subject to the papacy, so that any regulations passed by the Universit had to be published under papal auspices. Besides ordinary taxes, the community had to pay rents for houses in the ghetto, whether inhabited or not, and whether or not the tenants themselves could afford to pay. Increasing poverty required increasing sums for charity, taxes rose, and many wealthy people left the city. Regulations were passed to prevent anyone from removing his wealth from the city without permission, and a 2% tax was passed on the property of those who left.Beneath the textof each regulation, (from 1704 onward) is a tally of the commission's vote in passing the measure. While the text of the regulations is in Italian, five of the six pamphletshave additions in Hebrew emphasizing the importance of certain individual regulations and warning of the excommunication ( herem ) of anyone who failed to adhere to them. (Fourof these are on inserted leaves of which one is manuscript, the fifth is a printed addition on the last page of text.) Theformal Hebrew decree of excommunication appended to these regulations served both to emphasize the authority of the ""Universit"" and to insure that no individual could evade the regulation by professing ignorance of the Italian language. Among the promulgators of these writs of excommunicationwas Isaac Lampronti, communal leader and author of the encyclopedic Pahad Yitzhak ."1622,19-Dec-12,judaica-n08922,Important Judaica,USD,['Other'],"HAGGADAH, AMSTERDAM: SOLOMON PROOPS, 1695",15000,145,FALSE,10000,['Other'],8750,,['Other'],2012,"28 leaves (12 1/4 x 7 1/2 in.; 310 x 192 mm). <u>collation:</u> [1],1-6<sup>4</sup>, 7<sup>2</sup> [1]=28 leaves.

The artist Abraham ben Jacoba convert to Judaismborrowed most of the illustrations from Mathaeus Merian, a Christian artist. Between 1625 and 1630 Merian produced a large number of illustrations for both Bibles and history books which were well known all over Europe. It was from among these engravings that the illustrations for the Amsterdam Haggadah were chosen. Their popularity with the Jews of Europe was such that they were copied and recopied in succeeding haggadot printed in Europe and later in the United States well into the 20th century. Abraham ben Jacob introduced a whole new iconographic approach to haggadah illustration. Among his innovations were the image of the Temple in Jerusalem as well as a map of Canaan depicting the route of the Exodus and the boundaries of the Land of Israel. Theseimages, as well as his famous groupingof the Four Sons,appear in countless haggadot down to the present day.

Bernard Picart (1673-1733) was one of the most prolific and talented engravers of his age. Jean Frederic Bernard (1683-1744) was a French language bookseller and publisher of Huguenot descent based in Amsterdam. Together they prepared thousands of pages and hundreds of engravings that sought to capture the ritual and ceremonial life of all the known religions of the world. Crmonies et coutumes religieuses de tous les peuples du monde , or simply ""Picart"" as it was often subsequently known, broke with all the previous models. It attempted to present all religions, even those of the ""idolatrous peoples,"" as even-handedly as possible. It argued for religious toleration by showing the ill effects of fanaticism, wherever it could be found, and by praising those religions, such as Islam, that offered toleration to others. At a time of widespread anti-Semitism, it offered one of the most sympathetic portraits then available of European Jewry. Its translation into English removed some of the more radical comments about religion found in the original French text, though the Dutch one did not, and these translations, along with an abridgment in German, meant that the book and especially Picart's images became the standard means of portraying many of the world's religions until well into the 19th century.

The bill allowed ""persons professing the Jewish Religion"" who had been born outside of England to ""be naturalized by Parliament, without receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper."" The purpose of this legislation was not the general acceptance of Jews into Britain; naturalization would still require the passage of a private Act of Parliament which would be in reach of only a few of the wealthiest of England's 8,000 Jews. The bill passed the House of Lords on April 16, and then made it through the House of Commons on May 22. Although it met with little initial dispute inside or outside of Parliament, the Act elicited a tremendous popular furor immediately after its passage: pamphlets and prints, sermons, petitions, and newspaper coverage argued over the significance of the act throughout the summer and fall of 1753. Jewish peddlers were insulted and harassed in the streets and the murder of Jonas Levin in November of 1753 may have resulted from the passions sparked by the bill's passage. In that month, immediately after Parliament reconvened, the Act was repealed, the repeal passing the House of Lords on November 22 and the House of Commons on November 28.

First published in 1878, the text of the haggadah was edited by Hayyim Liberman, based on David Levis translation. The illustrations however, reflect two new innovations. Many of the images show demonstrate a marked reliance on traditional Midrashic and Aggadic texts (e.g. Miriams elongated arm; separate channels for each Tribe of Israel within the divided Red Sea, etc.) The other, even more significant advance is the addition of a distinctive American flavor to some of the illustrations. In the image of the building of Pharaohs store cities, the construction style and techniques are strongly reminiscent of the massive architecture of contemporary Chicago. The epitome of the new American iconography however, is seen in the totally novel rendition of the Four Sons, here for the first time ever, seated together at table. In this image, the generation gap between Eastern European immigrants and their assimilated wicked son is readily and painfully apparent. Having adopted new-fangled American ways, the son smokes, dresses in black clothes with a modish cut and dances on his tilted chair, demonstrating his disdain for his faith and tradition.

He single-handedly provided American Jews with many of the basic religious texts, institutions, and conceptual tools they needed to construct the cultural foundation of what would later emerge as the largest Jewish community in the history of the Jewish people. In addition to his decades of service in the pulpit of Philadelphia's congregation Mikveh Israel, Leeser's accomplishments as an architect of the American Jewish community include the founding of the Jewish Publication Society, the first Hebrew high school, and the first American Jewish rabbinical seminary. In 1843 he founded the monthly The Occident , the first successful Jewish newspaper in America and for 25 years, an important forum for articles on Jewish life and thought. In the Spring of 1849, Leeser promulgated a circular,calling for the disparate Jewish congregations across the nation to delegate representatives for a proposed convention to be held in June of that year. This was the latest in a series of steps taken by Leeser and his contemporaries, Isaac Mayer Wise and Max Lilienthal to try to effect the formation of a union of all Jewish congregations in the United States of America. Although the proposed convention never took place, Leeser retained this copy of the rare circular until late in 1853, when he used the blank side to draft an impassioned defense of his new bible translation, entitled Twenty-Four Books of the Holy Scriptures, which appeared in 1854. Leeser's Bible, as it has come to be known, was the result of 15 years of Isaac Leesers literary labors, and quickly became the standard Bible for English-speaking Jews, especially in America. The text of this manuscript was printed in the Occident in January of 1854. The present lot is a rare relic of the man who exerted the greatest influence on the development of traditional Judaism in19th-century America.

Rosenberg of Paris published an illustrated lithograph based on a kabbalistic understanding of Judaism. Its complexity required the simultaneous publication of an explicatory text in French. Rosenbergs work inspired Max Wollf, the recently retired Minister of Congregation Ohabei Shalom, in Boston, Massachusetts, to produce an English version. From the balcony of a huge and ornate temple, a man contemplates the terrestrial globe bursting forth from the midst of clouds and receiving luminous emanations from the Most High. Around him is an extravagant array of niches containing narrative scenes, friezes and frames enclosing blocks of text, rows of figures, Kabbalistic symbols and programs, zodiacal signs, and divine names. The explicatory volume, running to more than 100 pages, includes original poetry and Wollfs own commentary on the lithograph as well as a translation of Rosenbergs text.

Standing, from left to right are Julius Meyer (1839-1909), Chief Red Cloud (Oglala Sioux). Seated are Chiefs Sitting Bull (Miniconjou), Swift Bear (Arapahoe), and Spotted Tail (Brule). Julius Meyer was born in Prussia in 1839 and emigrated to Nebraska in 1867. It is said he was captured by Sioux during a buffalo hunt and lived with them for several years. Speaking six Indian languages, Meyer, who served as an Indian interpreter to Congress and as an Indian agent was known by the Native Americans as Curley-Headed White Chief with One Tongue because of his honesty. This image was taken while the delegation of Chiefs was en route to Washington, D.C. to meet with President Grant to discuss the fate of the Black Hills, a part of the Dakota territory set aside as an Indian reservation, but overrun by growing number of miners and settlers during the run-up to the Great Sioux War of 1876. Julius Meyer hosted the delegation in Omaha, and on May 13, 1875 took them to Frank Curriers studio, where the delegation demanded payment to be photographed. The Chiefs mission would ultimately prove fruitless and the ensuing Black Hills war would lead to tragic results on both sides including the massacre of Custer and the 7<sup>th</sup> Cavalry at the Little Big Horn in June of 1876. For the Native Americans, these events marked a sharp downward turn in their history, which would culminate in the massacres at Wounded Knee in 1890. Frank Currier has always been credited with the original large format (8.25 x 9.0 in) photograph. and many of the smaller albumen prints. Some of those were mounted on advertising for Julius Meyers Indian Wigwam store. This original albumen print however is on a standard carte de visite mount backmarked E. L.

Alperstein was born in Kobrin, in what is today Belarus, in 1853 and studied in the yeshivot of Vilna and Kovno, where his prodigious scholarship in both the Jerusalem and the Babylonian Talmuds was widely recognized. In 1881, he immigrated to the United States to assume a rabbinic post, first in New York and then in Chicago, where in 1887,he published this tractate. Three years later, Alperstein published a second edition, enlarged by a second title page, rabbinic approbations, and a new introduction.The most notable digression between the two editions however is in the way Alperstein refers to his Chicago congregants; in this first edition of Bikkurim , he heaps florid praise upon them, while in the second edition he disdainfully chastises them as wild boars. In his later years, Alperstein went on to become the first instructor at the Rabbi Isaac Elhanan Theological Seminary (Yeshiva University).

Catalogue Note <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-wrap""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-text""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-holder""> In our age of advanced computer technology and instant electronic mail, the picture postcard is a charming vestige of the past. Originally known as a ""postal card"", the postcard was created in 1869. This innovation, which afforded the opportunity to send mail inexpensively, rapidly became the most common and reliable method for communicating brief personal messages. Initially both sides of the card remained blank: the front contained the message, while the back was used for the address. In 1889 private publishers in Germany began issuing postcards with attractive pictures printed on the front side. The popularity of these picture postcards increased steadily and from 1898 until 1918, a period known as the ""Golden Age of the Postcard,"" countless picture postcards were produced and mailed throughout the world. Seeking to capitalize on this trend, publishers produced large sets of picture postcards that featured a seemingly endless variety of subject matter. These sets were avidly purchased, collected and traded by collectors. It was within this larger popular context that the Jewish postcards in this exhibition were produced. European and American Jews participated fully in the ""Postcard Craze"". The earliest and largest number of Jewish picture postcards were created for Rosh Ha-Shanah greetings. The custom of sending a New Year's message is documented as early as the 14th century when the Maharil, Rabbi Jacob of Moellin (1360?-1427), recommended that during the month of Elul one should include wishes for a good year in all written correspondence. This custom spread widely throughout the Ashkenazic world. The colorful images that adorn these postcards afford a nostalgic view into a bygone world. Although many of the images were staged, often featuring models who made multiple appearances in different settings and garb, they faithfully represented realistic elements of daily life. Contemporary dress, household interiors, family rituals, religious celebrations and special customs were meticulously recreated in studios. These postcards supply a panoramic view of Jewish daily life, both religious and secular, in the period preceding the devastation of European Jewry. Many other subjects were popular with the Jewish public as well. While the picture postcards of the non-Jewish world often focused on famous world monuments and tourist attractions, those produced for Jews frequently displayed Jewish monuments: synagogues from around the world. Of particular interest were the large and elaborate temples constructed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries across Europe and the United States. As many of the European synagogues were destroyed during the Holocaust, postcards are often the only known visual record of these majestic buildings. Another popular subject featured on these cards are ""exotic"" Jewish images, which captured the imagination of European Jews. The Orientalist Phenomenon in European culture translated in Jewish circles into the ""discovery"" of remote ethnic Jewish types. Thus many cards were illustrated with photographs of Jews from Yemen, Bukhara and other of Islamic lands, dressed in their colorful native garb. The photographers who traveled to countries such as Morocco and Tunisia visually preserved and recorded the Jewish quarters and the daily life of their inhabitants. These images were then widely distributed on postcards, providing European and American Jews with a glimpse into the little-known, remote comers of the Jewish world. Jewish postcards supplied the past and present spectator with rare and almost immediate documentation of important events in the life of the Jewish people: the early Zionist congresses, the building of new settlements and towns in Eretz Israel, the emigration from Europe and arrival in the New World. As such, Jewish picture postcards are a fascinating visual resource for the study of Jewish history."1647,19-Dec-12,judaica-n08922,Important Judaica,USD,['Americana'],"RABBINICAL RULING SIGNED BY RABBI AHARON KOTLER, RABBI MOSHE FEINSTEIN,...",7000,168,TRUE,5000,['Photographs'],6875,,"['Association items', 'Letters']",2012,"2 paper leaves, accompanied by photographic portraits of all four signatories.

The case being ruled upon revolves around a dispute between a mashgiah (a person with expertise in the laws ofritual slaughter and whose supervision is required to certify thatall meat slaughtered in a particular establishment meets therequirements of Jewish Law) named Haim Krasnow,inLawrence, Massachussetts, and householders in the community seeking to displace him. The ruling, signed by Rabbi Aharon Kotler, Moshe Feinstein, David Lifschitz and Rabbi Pinchas Mordechai Teitz finds that the unilateral action of the householders who convened a meeting headed by local rabbisthat resulted in a public denunciation of Krasnow and a prohibition on the sale or consumption of meat he had deemed kosher, was not in accordance with halakha . The Agudat Rabbonim here acted analogously to a court of appeals, and directed the parties to re-adjudicate their dispute before a legallly constituted rabbinical court. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (18951986) was a Lithuanian Orthodox rabbi, scholar and posek (an authoritative adjudicator of questions related to Jewish law), who was world-renowned for his expertise in Halakha and was regarded by many as the de facto supreme halakhic authority for Orthodox Jewry of North America during his lifetime. In the Orthodox world he is widely referred to simply as ""Reb Moshe"" , and his halakhic rulings are widely quoted in contemporary rabbinic literature. Rabbi Aharon Kotler (18911962) was an Orthodox Jewish rabbi and a prominent leader of Orthodox Judaism in Lithuania, and later the United States, where he built Beth Medrash Gavoha in Lakewood Township, New Jersey. Rabbi Dovid Lifshitz (19061993) was a distinguished Rosh yeshiva in the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) for almost fifty years. Rabbi Pinchas Mordechai Teitz (1908 1995)was the leader of the Orthodox community in Elizabeth for 60 years. He was revered for his developing of a small congregational community into a safe harbor for survivors from the Holocaust and a thriving network of synagogues and schools."1648,19-Dec-12,judaica-n08922,Important Judaica,USD,['Continental books and manuscripts'],"THE KENNICOTT BIBLE, FACSIMILE EDITION WITH ACCOMPANYING COMMENTARY VOLUME,...",7000,169,TRUE,5000,"['Fine bindings', 'Printed']",7500,,['Religion'],2012,"Two volumes: 454 folios+ 97 pages(11 x 8 in.; 293 x 222 mm). <u>facsimile volume</u>:454 folios (11 x 8 in.; 293 x 222 mm), plus the unboundlimitation page (#25 of 500 numbered, and 50 ad personam, copies ). 238 hand-illuminated pages; 24 canonical book headings; 49 parashah headings structured with gold in different motifs featuring zoomorphic figures in many colors; 27 lavishly-illuminated arcaded pages framing the text of the Sefer Mikhlol; 9 fully illuminated carpet pages; 150 psalm headings, numbered and illuminated in gold and silver.

Moss used the opportunity to create a wide-ranging visual commentary on Jewish history and experience. Using vivid and original metaphors, Moss confronts and illuminates some of the basic themes of Judaism: freedom, the passing on of tradition, persecution and the connection between the Passover story, the diaspora and the Land of Israel.<u><u></u></u> Each page of Mosss folio-sized Haggadah makes a visual and intellectual statement that surprises, delights and educates the viewer. Artistically, the work combines a spectacular variety of media: calligraphy, micrography, gouaches, gold leaf, acrylics and paper-cuts. This work accomplishes one of the original goals of the illuminated Haggadah: to stimulate the mind and the interest of the Seder's participants. More than a Haggadah, Mosss creation evolved into a broadly researched, imaginative and intensely personal reaction to the events of the Exodus and the Passover celebration. <u><u></u></u> The project consumed three years of Mosss full-time efforts and required research in libraries and museums on three continents. In 1985, Neil and Sharon Norry saw a photographic copy of the Haggadah and began pursuing the idea of publishing it. The patron of the original haggadah, Richard Levy, agreed to allow Moss to reproduce the work as a facsimile edition and the artist agreed, on the condition that the reproduction be faithful to the original in every respect: size, color, detail and special techniques and special, chemically neutral, paper was created to replace the vellum of the original. An accompanying commentary volume serves as an extraordinary teaching tool and erudite explication of the symbolism of each page of the haggadah, within the broader context of the meaning of Passover. <u><u></u></u> In 1988, when the New York Public Library mounted what was at the time widely hailed as the denitive exhibition of the Hebrew book, A Sign and a Witness . Of the thirteen important and beautiful Haggadah manuscripts exhibited, only one was created after 1717: The Moss Haggadah. Copies of this magnificent work rarely appear in the market and none has ever been recorded at auction."1652,19-Dec-12,judaica-n08922,Important Judaica,USD,['Other'],THE KAGAN-MAREMBA ISRAEL COINS AND MEDAL COLLECTION,500000,172,TRUE,300000,['Other'],572500,,['Other'],2012,"Literature  Sylvia Haffner Magnus, Israels Money and Medals (4th ed.).

The Jewish Museum, New York, gift of Mrs. Felix Warburg, S563 (Norman L. Kleeblatt and Vivian B. Mann, Treasures of the Jewish Museum ) - Johann Adam Boller, Frankfurt, 1706-1732. The Jewish Museum, New York, gift from the Estate of Alice B. Goldschmidt, 1983-160 (illustrated Kleeblatt and Mann, op. cit., fig. 23) The group comes from a narrow circle of Frankfurt workshops: that of Johann Valentin Schler (master 1680), his brother Johann Michael Schler (master 1684), and the latters brother-in-law Johann Adam Boller (master 1706). The brothers father was Michael Schler, also a silversmith. Johann Valentin was born in 1650, apprenticed in 1666 to Jacob Rap, and in 1680 married Anna Margaretha Gldenmundt, daughter of a shoemaker; they had three children. Scheffler records Johann Valentin as being buried in 1720. The model and its silver-gilt finish are derived from Biblical descriptions of the seven-branched candelabrum in the Tabernacle of the Temple: Make a lampstand of pure gold. Hammer out its base and shaft, and make its flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms of one piece with them. (Exodus 25:31). The spreading branches also evoke the tree of life, itself a symbol for the Torah. The Midrash on Deuteronomy states, As the oil (of the menorah) gives life to the world, the words of the Torah bestow life to the world. As this oil lights up the world, the words of the Torah enlighten the world. The Torah is a Tree of Life and a Menorah (R. Wischnitzer, Gestalten und Symbole in der j dischen Kunst (Berlin 1935), pp. 59-60, cited Weber, op. cit., p. 178). The finial on all seven of the lamps is formed as Judith with the head of Holofernes. In addition to the Judith story as being another example of the Jews triumphing over the enemies, like the Hanukah story itself, Chaya Benjamin records additional links between Judith and the festival, as the heroine was descended from the Hasmoneans, and she is honored as part of the Festival of the Maidens on the seventh night of Hanukah in some Mediterranean Jewish cultures. The lamp by Johann Valentin Schler in the Steiglitz Collection at the Israel Museum is closest stylistically to the offered example. The pattern of balls and buds on the arms, the bulbous shaft, and knop of S-scroll brackets are all shared by both. Even closer is the square base chased with acanthus at the corners, open brackets, and shaped shell and foliate feet. These feet also occur on the lamp in the Frankfurt Jewish Museum which Annette Weber has associated with a wedding in 1681; if so, these three could represent the initial conception of the model, which would be altered and developed by Johann Valentin, his brother, and Boller over the three decades. The laws governing the Frankfurt ghetto were supposed to restrict its population to 500 families, with a maximum of 12 marriages per year. However, the reality of the extensive Jewish population made the ghetto one of the most densely populated places in Europe. Families of Court Jews and recent immigrants from farm communities were all crowded together into the short stretch of the Judengasse. The wealth and importance of the community can be judged, though, by the impressive silver pieces created for it (by Christian craftsmen), and the official recognition from 1718 of the representatives of the ghetto by the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. Sumptuary laws give another insight into the richness of the Frankfurt community, and the larger role of a familys silver pieces. In 1715 after the terrible 1711 fire which almost totally destroyed the ghetto the Jewish Council restricted what silver objects could be displayed at the Spinholtz , the reception held at the brides house on Friday afternoon before the Saturday evening ceremony.

It is interesting to note that Mayhew and Ince were working at Broadlands from 1765-74 and then again from 1788-92 and may have supplied the seat furniture. Interestingly, the present seats share similarities to another one of Mayhew and Ince's commissions, namely the seat furniture in the Tapestry Room at Croome Court, supplied to George William, 6<sup>th</sup> Earl of Coventry in 1769, the room being designed by Robert Adam and hung with tapestries specifically ordered from the Gobelins manufactory (Peck et al, <i>op. cit. </i>pp. 156-167). The overall form of the legs with their large stiff-leaf carved upper part and the large reeded foot is similar to the legs on this suite of furniture. Interestingly a design by Robert Adam of the DrawingRoom at Northumberland House includesa suite of seat furniture with spiral legs similar to the legs on the present seats (Harris, op. cit. no. 66); furthermore, the firm of Mayhew and Ince were supplying furniture to the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland between 1772-73.

At eighteen, he left forDsseldorfto study at the art academy and a year later traveled to Paris. It was there that Ury's interest in depicting the urban experience originated. Much of Ury's <i>oeuvre</i> is defined by his depictions of the Berlin metropolis. Emily Bilski notes that whereas Ury's contemporaries painted views of ""Old Berlin"", he chose to convey the life of the urbanite and the emerging modes of modernism, including transportation and electricity. He endeavored to show ""the particular blend of closeness and distance that characterizes human encounters in the public spaces of the street and the caf. Ury was mesmerized by the perceptual phenomena of pedestrians and horse-drawn carriages reflected in the wet asphalt of rain-swept streets, of street lamps casting long beams of light onto the boulevards at night, of electric light refracted off the mirrors and large windows of the city's cafes.""

Their artists talents were evident from an early age and eventually, they attended the exclusive and prestigious Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. They painted together and despite their distinctive artistic styles, it was not unusual for them to add details to each others artwork. In the early 1930s, the Seidenbeutels often traveled to Krakow, depicting the happy and blissful environment there. According to Mieczyslaw Wallis, ""their many new paintings had little to do with the well-known monuments of Krakow but were views of the city's suburbs and byways ? of red-tiled roofs, vegetable gardens, families sitting down to dinner as smoke rose from the chimneys of their homes."" As the 1940s approached, the Seidenbeutels' work began to change, often reflecting the political climate of the impending war and the increasing sense of fear felt among the Jewish community in Poland. The brothers lost their lives at the hands of the Nazis at Flossenburg concentration camp just before it was liberated in April 1945.

Martinique was an important French sugar colony which had resisted attack three years prior when the British had captured the nearby French sugar colony of Guadeloupe. The attack was fought on steep and uneven terrain, culminating at the high ground of Morne Grenier. A pivotal position in the battle, the British armies overtook the hill and secured firing positions over the French fort, forcing the French to surrender at Fort Royal on February 4<sup>th</sup>. This victory proved Monckton's skill as a leader, defeating the French forces in a matter of weeks. The battle proved a significant victory for the British, helping to end France's position as a major colonial power in the Americas.

Following a conversation with the artist, Liat Stanislavsky discusses Sasportas Fan project and comments: ""The Japanese contexts of the fan project lie in the Far East... It is a domain that processes a classical formal structure of a fan in a manner that opens up a new reading, one that carries a borrowed image. The size of the fan, its mode of opening, and the relation to the image it bears generate a reversal in its reading. An object that has undergone a different cultural processing that presents itself in pale hues, deadened a-priori... In this sense, the fan proposes an open possibility of image contraction and expansion. Moreover, it allows for a reading of the fan as a space of covering, concealment or presence of a nonexistent mountain."" (Liat Stanislavsky, Loushy Art &amp; Editions, following a conversation with Yehudit Sasportas, 2002-2003)."2703,24-Nov-09,israeli-and-international-art-n08605,Israeli and International Art,USD,[],LESSER URY,15000,139,TRUE,10000,[],21250,HOLLÄNDISCHES DORF (DUTCH VILLAGE),[],2009,"signed L.

Catalogue Note <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-wrap""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-text""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-holder"">  As part of the ongoing polemical struggle that pitted European Jewry against itself, in June of 1755, Jonathan Eybeschuetz published <i>Luhot ha-Edut</i> (see lot 133) in which he countered many of the allegations leveled at him by Jacob Joshua Falk and his other accusers. In the two years since Falk had publicly called for Eybeschuetz to be defrocked (see previous lot), Falk had suffered a great deal for his dogged attempts to force Eybeschuetz to present himself before a rabbinical court with Falk at its head. Forced from his rabbinic post, Falk left Frankfurt and wandered between Mannheim, Worms and Offenbach. Now, near the end of his life and no longer in public office, Falk responded with this scathing critique to <i>Luhot ha-Edut</i>, asserting that it was in and of itself further proof of Eybeschuetz' heresy. Falk went even further by assailing those rabbis who had supported Eybeschuetz, notwithstanding the latter's vindication by the <i>Va'ad Arba'ah Aratzot</i> (Council of Four Lands). Falk died in January of 1756, less than six months after this letter was written and printed, not having succeeded in forcing Eybeschuetz out of office. Nevertheless, the constant focus brought to bear by Falk and his allies on what they saw as a resurgence of the Sabbatian heresy as embodied in Jonathan Eybeshuetz, ensured the long term victory of mainstream Judaism over heterodoxy. As far as is known, the present broadsheet containsFalk's last public utterance regarding Eybeschuetz, and as such, serves as his enduring epitaph. Though mentioned in thevast scholarly literature, no extant copies of the present broadsheet are recorded."2742,24-Nov-09,important-judaica-n08606,Important Judaica,USD,[],P&#39;SAK ME-BET DIN ZEDEK (RABBINICAL BAN AGAINST AN UNKNOWN AUTHOR [SAUL...,7000,136,TRUE,5000,[],9375,,[],2009,"1 folio (13 x 8 1/4 in.; 330 x 206 mm).

Catalogue Note <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-wrap""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-text""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-holder"">  The formal paying of homage to the ruling authorities was a vestige of medieval feudal practices in which each of the various constituent estates within the realm swore allegiance to the ruler who in turn guaranteed their protection. Jews had long been seen as a separate constituency within the European nations in which they lived, disconnected from the nobility, the peasantry and the merchant classes. Thus it was incumbent upon them to offer their allegiances as a separate group. Naturally, the paying of homage required renewal whenever a change occurred in the composition of the reigning authority. Following the third and final partition of Poland in 1775, Krakow and the adjacent Jewish city Kazimierz fell under Austrian rule. The present lot documents the formal homage of the Jews of Kazimierz to Prince Karl Joseph Anton von Auersperg (1720-1800), a member of the Princely family of Auersperg, originally from Carniola, one of the hereditary Habsburg duchies in what is now Slovenia. Created for formal presentation to the Prince, the document was printed on luxurious silk rather than on paper or parchment, as a way of demonstrating the exceedingly high esteem in which the Jewish community held their secular ruler."2744,24-Nov-09,important-judaica-n08606,Important Judaica,USD,[],"THE HAGGADAH, ILLUMINATED BY ARTHUR SZYK, EDITED BY CECIL ROTH, LONDON:...",45000,138,TRUE,35000,[],43750,,[],2009,"Large quarto (11 x 9 3/8 in.; 280 x 237 mm).

""Save [us], I pray!"") During the recitation of <i>Hoshanot</i>, the worshippers proceed in a circuit around the <i>bimah</i> in the center of the synagogue.

Pray! O Lord, give success, I pray!'"" The <i>hoshanot</i> of the seventh day, <i>Hoshana Rabba</i>, are of a special character.

Catalogue Note <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-wrap""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-text""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-holder"">  According to Jewish custom, the seven week period between Passover and Shavuot is marked by the counting of the omer . For forty-nine days, starting with the 16th of Nissan, the second day of Passover on which the korban ha-omer or new grain offering was brought in the Temple, a special blessing is recited and the particular day of the omer iscounted. At the beginningof the eighteenth century, decorative manuscripts were produced in order to facilitate the observance of this commandment and to ensure that each day was properly enumerated. Every page of the present manuscript repeats the same decorative program as well as the same textual format,beginningwith the Hebrew date. This is followed by the actual enumeration of the day and week, the essence of the performance of the commandment of counting the omer . In an uncommon departure from the standard version of the text, the present manuscript follows the unique ruling of the thirteenth century Italian scholar Zedakiah ben Abraham ha-Rofe of the Anavim family. In his <i>Shibbolei ha-Leket</i>, for many years the most widely disseminated halakhic work in Italy, he specifies ""Today in the omer is ..."" rather than ""Today is ... days of the omer ."" The manuscript opens with a rhyming preamble stating that ""here, you have all the mystical intentions forall the days of the omer, and, if you have a brain in your head, you will perform this commandment to provide pleasure to your creator."" Despite the somewhat droll introduction the manuscript continues with a set of instructions detailing the proper kabbalistic and mystical manner of counting the omer. According to the kabbalistic tradition which posits the existence of ten sefirot , or divine emanations, it is believed that the lower seven sefirot are particularly manifest during the seven weeks of the omer . Each of the seven weeks of the omer -counting is associated with one of these seven lower sefirot . Each day of each week is likewise associated with one of these same seven sefirot , creating forty-nine permutations. Similarly there are forty-nine permutations of the Tetragrammaton, the ineffable four-letter name of God; these are achieved by varying the vocalization or <i>nikkud</i> rather than the letters. Each day's page also calls for three specific <i>kavvanot</i> or intentions, focusing on one of the forty-nine words of Psalm 67, then on one of the forty-nine letters of verse 5 of the same Psalm. The final kavvanah is focused on the forty-two letter mystical name of God. The division into forty-nine parts is accomplished by dividing the name into eight groups of six letters each with each grouping punctuated by a recapitulation of the entire sextet as a single word."2759,24-Nov-09,important-judaica-n08606,Important Judaica,USD,[],"PENITENTIAL PRAYERS, MANNHEIM OR HEIDELBERG: 1791, SCRIBE: KASMAN BEN...",8000,153,TRUE,6000,[],7500,,[],2009,"36 leaves (4 1/2 x3 3/8 in.; 115 x 85 mm).

After the persecutions of the First Crusade, affected communities recorded the names of those who had perished, incorporating these lists of names into the liturgy. <i>Memorbuchs</i> take their name from either the <i>almemar</i> (platform), upon which the reader kept the book while reciting from it, or from the Latin word <i>memoria</i>, meaning memory. Many <i>memorbuecher</i> also contained some of the prayers to be recited on Sabbath morning betweenthe <i>Shaharit</i> and <i>Musaf</i> services. The earlier of these two <i>memorbuch</i> manuscripts was penned by Moses Aaron Lorie. It was presented to the Hand in Hand asylum by the scribe's brother, Saul Tzvi (S.H.) Lorie in 1864, in memory of their recently deceased mother. More than 40 years later, the same S.H. Lorie, now bereaved of his father and wife as well as his mother, donated a nearly identical volume to the Brighton Hebrew Congregation. The calligraphy and style of the manuscript suggest that it too, was the work of Lorie's brother, Moses Aaron. London's Hand in Hand Asylum was established in 1840 for the purpose of clothing, maintaining and providing asylum for the ""aged and decayed tradesmen"" in the Jewish community. In 1884, the asylum merged with the Widows' Home Asylum and subsequently with the Jewish Home, formingthe Home for Aged Jews. Brighton's Hebrew congregation began holding services in its own building in 1792, relocating in 1808, 1823 and 1874. Though the town's Jewish population was relatively stable, the constant expansion was necessary to accommodate the growing numbers of Jewish visitors to the seaside resort, including the Goldsmid and Sasoon families."2762,24-Nov-09,important-judaica-n08606,Important Judaica,USD,[],"PRAYERBOOK WITH KAVVANOT (KABBALISTIC MEDITATIONS) OF SHALOM SHARABI,...",55000,156,FALSE,45000,[],0,,[],2009,"5 volumes (11 x 8 1/2 in.;280 x 220 mm).

Shar'abi initiated what is still the most active school of mysticism in contemporary Middle Eastern Jewry. This meditative tradition continues to rise in popularity not only in Jerusalem where it originated but throughout the Jewish World. As a young man Sharabi emigrated to Jerusalem where he attended the kabbalistic yeshiva <i>Bet El</i>, founded in 1737 by the renowned kabbalist Gedaliah Hayon, whom Sharabi succeeded in 1751. Among the characteristic mystical practices of <i>Bet El</i> most closely associated with the writings and personality of Sharabi are the infusion of ritual prayers with mystical ""intentions,"" or <i>kavvanot</i>. The <i>kavvanot</i> themselves are the product of thousands of years of development and incorporate many traditions and bodies of lore, the principle aspect of which is the meditation on God's sacred names during the recitation of prayers. The first volume bears the supralibros inscription ofGrand Rabbi David Biderman of Lelov (1844-1918), scion of the Lelov dynasty of Hasidim whoaccompanied his father, Elazar Mendel and grandfather, Moses of Lelov, to the Holy Land in 1851, the first Hasidic dynasty whose Grand Rabbis took up residence in Jerusalem.Vols. II-V were purchased by the present owner from a descendant of the Biderman family.

Just as the holiday of Purim was established as a day of thanksgiving commemorating the salvation of the Jewish people, many communities and individuals celebrated latter-day episodes of escape from oppression or deliverance from persecution by establishing communal or personal holidays. Called <i>Purim Katan </i>(Minor Purim) in emulation of the biblical archetype, these holidays were observed by the recitation of special prayers as well as by the recording of the miraculous events for posterity. The present manuscript relates the rescue and deliverance of Joseph Shochet ben Hirsch Mizlap ineighteenth-century Prague. In the summer of 1744, Prague was besieged by Frederick the Great of Prussia whose troops entered and ransacked the city beginning on the 17th of November. As part of the city militia, Jews participated in the defense of Prague and on November 26th the Austrian army succeeded in recapturing the city. Nevertheless, rumors circulated that the Jews had supported the Prussian invaders and anti-Jewish riots broke out in the Jewish Quarter. Over the course of two days, more than thirty Jews were killed and many more were injured. Joseph Mizlap, scion of a distinguished Jewish family in Prague was sorely wounded but survived the devastating attack and wrote this document to record both the calamitous events and his eventual deliverance. In it he enjoined all successive generations of his descendants to observe the date of his miraculous salvation as a family holiday, in perpetuity. The small bold letters that appear on the right-hand side of the double-acrostic text read ""Joseph Shochet, son of Hirsch Mizlap, parnas of the holy community of Prague, may God preserve it,<i>Amen Selah.</i>"" On the left-hand side, the enlarged letters form a chronogram indicating the date."2764,24-Nov-09,important-judaica-n08606,Important Judaica,USD,[],AN ILLUSTRATED AL HA-GEFEN PLAQUE (BLESSING RECITED AFTER DRINKING WINE)...,7000,158,TRUE,5000,[],26250,,[],2009,"1 broadsheet (14 x 10 in.; 363 x 260 mm).

In the 1850's, the traveler Jacob Saphir, an emissary from Jerusalem, becamethe first to write about the Jewish community in Indonesia after alocal Jew told him about twenty Jewish families living in Jakarta and several more in Surabaya and Semarang. In the late nineteenth century, a group of Baghdadi Jews settled in Surabaya and soon became the dominant component of the Jewish community there. They were meticulous in their adherence to traditional ritual observance and maintained close commercial and social ties with their relatives in Bombay, Calcutta, and Rangoon. It is therefore not surprising that the decorative motifs employed to ornament this marriage contract are typical of those found on ketubbot from the Baghdadi community of Calcutta.

There is nevertheless a long tradition of private ownership of scrolls as well. In fact, Judaism considers both the ownership and the writing of Torah scrolls to be obligatory positive commandments. Given the expense and great degree of complexity inherent in producing a Torah scroll that is fit for ritual use, most individual Jews are unable to fulfill those commandments. For those few individuals with a consummate level of skill, or more likely, with the financial wherewithal to hire someone that skilled, the opportunity to possess a Torah Scroll became a reality."2781,24-Nov-09,important-judaica-n08606,Important Judaica,USD,[],"MINIATURE TORAH SCROLL, EASTERN EUROPE, CA. 1900",26000,175,FALSE,22000,[],0,,[],2009,"Scroll (Height of parchment: 4 3/16 in.

In addition, miniature scrolls could be more easily stored in a private residence without requiring the construction of a large ark such as those used to house the communal torah scrolls, found in most synagogues.

Dreyfus, falsely accused of selling military secrets to Germany, received an unfair trial by a secret military commission. Stripped of his rank, he was sentenced to life imprisonment on Devil's Island. It was only after the affair had dragged on for a dozen years thathe was finally cleared of all charges by the court of appeals, exonerated, and reinstated. The Dreyfus case split Frenchsociety intoopposing camps, riven with hostile rhetoric, political turmoil,and propelled open andvirulent anti-Semitic expression in thecountry's press. Musee des Horreurs is one example of the potent reactions to theaffair. The posters, designed and engraved by French-Algerian militant, V. Lenepveu,were launched at the retrial of Dreyfus in Rennes in August 1899 and sold by subscription,at newsstands, andby hawkers and street vendors.Its malicious caricaturesattack prominent Dreyfusard personalities, degrading them with offensive images and texts. The eight original caricatures from the set in the present lot include: Emile Zola (Le roi des Porcs), drawing for poster no. 4 Fernand Labori,defense attorney for both Dreyfus and Zola (Trou de balle), drawing for poster no. 5 Alfred Dreyfus (Le Traitor), drawing for poster no. 6 Jean Jaures, journalist (L'elephant du Jourdain), drawing for poster no. 14 Emile Loubet, President of France, Chief Rabbi Zadoc Kahn,Lieutenant-Colonol George Picquart, French officer who exposed the affair, Joseph Reinach, Emile Zola, and Alfred Dreyfus (Un bal a l'Elysee), drawing for poster no. 26 Yves-Guyot, Former Minister of Publc Works, journalist and director of the Dreyfusard newspaper Le Siecle (Porte ca a Dreyfus), drawing for poster no. 29 Joseph Reinach, politican (Que le chambardement commence), drawing for poster no. 34 Nathan Mayer,son of Anselm Mayer, the founder of a London bank, (Nathan Mayer ou l'origine des millards), drawing for poster no. 42 We are grateful to Professor Bertrand Tillier of the University of Paris, author ofthe recently published ""Les artistes et l'affaireDreyfus: 1898 - 1908"" for his expertise and opinion."2854,24-Nov-09,important-judaica-n08606,Important Judaica,USD,[],JOSÉ SCHNEIDER,20000,94,FALSE,15000,[],0,STUDYING IN SYNAGOGUE,[],2009,signed Jos Schneider andwith artist'sdevice lower left oil on canvas 41 1/2 by 55 1/2 in. 105.4 by 141 cm.2855,24-Nov-09,important-judaica-n08606,Important Judaica,USD,[],ISIDOR KAUFMANN,80000,95,TRUE,60000,[],230500,PORTRAIT OF A RABBI,[],2009,"signed Isidor Kaufmann lower left oil on panel 12 7/8 by 9 5/8 in. 32.7 by 24.4 cm.

As Igor Emmanuilovich Grabar described Somov's curious oeuvre, ""...even then, his 'un-Russian' features stood out from the conventional work of his contemporaries. His works were more subtle, temperate, cerebral, and superior in draftsmanship to those of others. His drawings were altogether different from anything else being done in the studio; to us they seemed affected and simulated, clearly imitating and copying some original illustrations from foreign magazines, most of all from the English <i>Studio""</i> (Igor Emmanuilovich Grabar, <i>Moia Zhizn: Automonografiia Etiudy o Khudozhnikakh,</i> Izd-vo Respublika, 2001, p. 241). Indeed, it can be said that Somov's style was largely derived from the British movement called <i>Decadence</i> (1880-1900), where contemporary artists ridiculed high Victorian values. The publication of the <i>World of Art</i> journal introduced the Russian public to the latest accomplishments in Western graphic arts of English, German, French and Belgian artists who were oriented on the modern ethics. As a prominent member of the World of Art group, Somov was largely responsible for the design of the collective's journal, as well as for the development of a new graphic style. The artist's reemerging theme of sensuality is vastly explored in the 1907 Hans von Weber, Munich publication of <i>Das Lesebuch der Marquise</i>. The book comprised ""gallant"" eighteenth century literary excerpts, chosen by Franz von Blei and lasciviously illustrated by Konstantin Andreevich Somov. Anticipating censorship, Somov made two versions of illustrations for the edition; later, the publishing house would print only the restrained version. In 1914, Somov began another series of drawings, and he independently selected his own anthology of frivolous excerpts from works by Voltaire, Casanova and others. It was four years before he finished the project, and <i>Grande Livre de la Marquise</i> was finally published in St. Petersburg (not in Venice, as the edition falsely claimed). The present lot is an example of erotic imagery from this publication. Sergei Makovsky remarked, ""Somov's eroticism is that of a past life, profoundly interpreted by the contemporary artist and perfected into a sensuality of unexpected naivet and, above all, tempting suggestions"" (Sergei Makovsky, <i>Contemporary Russian Graphic Art</i>, Petrograd, 1917, p. 13). The present rendition of <i>Sim</i><i>pl</i><i>e Pleasures </i>is executed in the style of eighteenth century silhouette drawings; the exquisite draftsmanship is characteristic of Somov's linear graphics. Despite the daring frivolity of the subject matter, the erotic scene is intricately woven with wit and rare refinement. Somov daringly blurs the lines between masculinity and femininity by painting the male and female forms almost indistinguishably. The subjects appear equally delicate and playful, and their forms unify as they mold together in the dark. In 1916, Russian poet Mikhail Kuzmin remarked: ""Restlessness, irony, theatrics of the world, the comedy of eroticism, variegation of masquerade freaks, devious candle light, fireworks and rainbows--suddenly morbid depths of death, sorcery--skull, hidden under the cloth and flowers, the mechanical love stances, deadliness and terror of cordial smiles--this is the spirit of a whole range of Somov's creations. Oh, how dour is this gallant Somov! What a dire mirror he offers to the delighted feast!--Comme il est lourd tout cet amour leger"" (<i>How arduous you are, uncom</i><i>pl</i><i>icated love</i>, as quoted in Urii Bezelianskii's <i>Ulybka Dzhokondy: Kniga o Khudozhnikakh,</i> Moscow: OAO Izd-vo ""Raduga,"" 1999, p. 282)."2919,5-Jun-09,old-master-19th-century-european-art-n08559,Old Master &amp; 19th Century European Art,USD,[],VINCENT G.
