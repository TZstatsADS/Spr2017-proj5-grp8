Catalogue Note <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-wrap""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-text""> <div class=""lotdetail-catalogue-notes-holder""> This painting, signed and dated 1811 , repeats the composition of Peyron's celebrated workin the Muse des Augustins, Toulouse (inv. RO 195, 93 by 132 cm., signed and dated 1779 ), which was commissioned along with its pendant, Cornelia, Mother of the Gracchi , by the abb Franois de Bernis, later Archbishop of Rouen. The works probably traveled to Albi with the abb de Bernis in March 1782, though the Belisarius was exhibited, with much praise, at Palazzo Mancini in Rome in 1779. Another version of the composition (possibly the sketch for the Toulouse canvas), is in the National Gallery, London (inv. no.NG6551).<sup>1</sup> The theme of Belisarius, derived from Marmontel's novel 'Blisaire' (1767), was very popular at the time; Peyron's rival Jacques-Louis David also painted the subject, the same year that Peyron exhibited his version at Palazzo Mancini. Given the positive reception of Peyron's Toulouse canvases, particularly the Belisarius , it is unsurprising that he would have continued to produce versions of the painting for private patrons throughout his career. 1.
